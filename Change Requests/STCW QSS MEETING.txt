To: George Benway <gbenway@maritime.edu>, Katherine McClellan <kmcclellan@maritime.edu>,  Brigid Pavilonis <bpavilonis@maritime.edu>, James McKenna <jmckenna@maritime.edu>,  Will Haynes <whaynes@maritime.edu>, David Mackey <dmackey@maritime.edu>

Hello, All -- Capt. Pavilonis would like to get a QSS meeting on the books.  For those of you who are new to QSS (Quality Standards Systems), it is our vehicle for continuous improvement.  It is an ad hoc committee and so please invite anyone from your department who would benefit the group to attend. As an example of tasks that we need to undertake, I can think of a couple that will be on the agenda:

1.  MT-4253 -- due to Earl Mayhofer's retirement, several of the tasks and assessments assigned to this course have been redistributed to other courses.  We need to make sure that these changes are accurately reflected in our assessment matrix that we submit to the USCG.

2.  There is going to be a change in the RADAR and ARPA classes (they will be combined) and that needs to go into the matrix.

3.  New training ship assessments for both departments will need to be inserted into the matrix (as they come).

We are looking to hold this meeting on April 20.  Please look for a Doodle from me and let me know your availability.

Thank you!  Best, Marie.
