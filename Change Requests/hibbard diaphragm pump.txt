1. Replace Reciprocating pump maintenance assessment 8-2B (done in aux 1)
with Diaphragm pump maintenance lab (to be one on ship with 3/c)

This will better satisfyl NIVC 17-14 task 9.1.c, which calls for diaphragm pump maintenance.

2.  Talk to Jim Albani about any simulator assessments which would be better done on the new ship.

3.  Move gage glass lab from 3/c on ship to Steam Generator lab.
