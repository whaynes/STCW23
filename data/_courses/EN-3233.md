### Course Description

Covers the principles, design, operation, maintenance, and repair of marine steam turbines including their reduction gears, thrust bearings, couplings, governors, and lubrication systems. Line shafting, bearings, and propellers are other topics included. This course also includes an introduction to the design and operation of gas turbines. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester, six 3-hour labs  with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.
