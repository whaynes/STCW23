### Job Specifications [specs-oicew-1-1G]

Test shall be conducted in accordance with _ASTM Standard E1417 Visible Dye Penetrant Procedure (Type II Method C)_ or equivalent.

  1. Specimens should be visually examined for flaws before the application of penetrant.
  2. Specimens should be cleaned to remove contaminates that could prevent penetrant from entering discontinuities and thoroughly dried.
  3. Apply a thin, even coating of penetrant to the part by spraying.
  4. Allow the penetrant to dwell on the surface for 10 minutes or longer.
  5. Remove excess surface penetrant by wiping the surface with a dry lint-free cloth. Try to minimize the number of times the surface is wiped as each pass of the cloth could pull penetrant from a flaw.
  6. Finish the cleaning by dampening a cloth by spraying with solvent and wiping the surface one final time.
  7. Apply a light uniform coating of well agitated, non-aqueous wet developer by spraying. Excess developer will reduce the sensitivity of the inspection; this is the most common error made with liquid penetrants.
  8. Inspect the surface as the developer works to pull the penetrant from any surface breaking flaws to produce an indication. Allow the sample to develop for a minimum of 10 minutes.
  9. Record the location, size, orientation and other features of interest of any indications produced by the inspection.
  10. Clean all specimens by rinsing off the developer.

### Recommended Evaporator Start-up Procedure (TS Kennedy Specific)

**Check** that the following valves are open: 

  * Brine pump overboard 
  * Chemical feed pump discharge 
  * Feed heater attemporator supply 
  * Sea water heater vent to drain regulator 
  * Sea water heater drain to bilge 
  * Air ejector condensers drain to bilge 
  * Distillate pump sealing line 
  * Distillate pump discharge valve 
  * Distillate discharge to distribution manifold 
  * Inlet valve to reserve feed or potable tank 
  * Sea water suction valve to sea water supply 

**Check that the following valves are closed:**

  * Air ejector condenser drain to ADT 
  * Sea water feed heater drain to auxiliary condenser 
  * Sea water feed regulating valves to 1st effect/Brine pump discharge 

**Start:**

  * Sea water feed pump and throttle inlet to 1st effect 
  * Chemical feed pump (insure proper level in tank) 
  * Brine pump and maintain level in 2nd effect hotwell 

**Open:**

  * Steam supply to air ejectors 
  * Steam supply to feed heaters (auxiliary exhaust or L.P. bleed) 
  * Feed heat attemporator root valve from condensate system 

**Turn on:**

Salinity panel (insure 3 way dump valve is tripped to bilge) 

**Monitor:**

  * Feed heater shell temperature between 185-205° F. 
  * Sea water feed temperature between 165-170° F. 

**Start:**

Distillate pump, and regulate level by throttling discharge valve 

**Line up:**

  * 3-way trip valve to proper tanks when salinity is less than .25 gpg 
  * Secure air ejector condenser drain to bilge and direct drains to ADT 
  * Secure sea water feed heater drain to bilge and direct drains to the auxiliary condenser 




### Reverse-osmosis start-up procedure

1. Make a cursory examination of the plant to ensure that the system is intact, that all components are fully assembled, and that the unit is in a state of operational readiness.
2. Ensure that all pre-filter, media filter and cartridge filter drain and vent valves are closed.
3. Opens all sea water valves from the sea chest up to the unit, the sea water inlet cock valve, and the feed water pump isolation valves if the unit is so equipped.
4. Position the 3-way feed/rinse/clean/store valve to the normal feed position and lines up the media filter isolation, back-flush, and waste outlet valve for normal operation.
5. Position the 3-way media filter outlet valve to the normal feed position to the cartridge pre-filters.
6. Open the back pressure regulator bypass valve fully and completely backs off on the back pressure regulator valve.
7. Position the 3-way brine discharge/rinse/clean/store valve to the normal overboard position and ensures that all the brine discharge valves to the overboard skin valve are all open.
8. Ensure that electrical power is established to the unit by closing the appropriate circuit breaker.
9. Checs oil level in high pressure pump crankcase, and add oil as necessary.
10. Place the feed pump and feed booster pump switches in the automatic mode as appropriate if so equipped.
11. Depresse the unit salinity controller start switch, observe feed pump, booster feed pump, and high pressure pump pressures and feed flow meter, bleeds air from pre-filter, media filter, and cartridge pre-filters as needed, and checks for system leaks.
12. Once proper feed has been established, slowly close the back pressure regulator bypass valve, and close in on back pressure regulator until manufacturer recommended design pressure is reached for the existing sea water salinity. Observe the fresh water product flow meter.
13. Line up the fresh water system valves to permit delivery of fresh water to the fresh water storage tank on service and monitor the salinity of the fresh water product.
14. Ensure that an acceptable salinity is eventually reached on fresh water product and that the 3-way fresh water product diverting valve switches from the overboard discharge to the fresh water delivery mode
15. Monitors system, pressures, flows, and salinity to ensure that parameters remain within acceptable limits.

### Reverse-osmosis shut-down procedure

1. Depress the unit salinity controller stop switch and ensures that the feed pump, booster feed pump, and high pressure pump all stop rotating and that their respective indicator lights go out.
2. Close all sea water valves from the sea chest up to the unit, the sea water inlet cock valve, and the feed water pump isolation valves if the unit is so equipped.
3. Open any valves in the cleaning tank discharge line to the unit 3-way feed feed/rinse/clean/store valve.
4. Position the 3-way feed/rinse/clean/store valve to the rinse position and line up the media filter isolation, back-flush, and waste outlet valve for normal operation.
5. Ensure that multi-media filter and cartridge pre-filter drain valves are closed.
6. Open the back pressure regulator bypass valve, and backs off on the back pressure regulator valve fully to release the pressure from the unit.
7. Ensure that the 3-way brine/clean/store/rinse valve is in the normal brine discharge position.
8. Fill the cleaning tank with chlorine free product fresh water.
9. Place the booster pump control switch to the “hand” position and observes the feed flow meter.
10. When the feed flow meter indicates no flow (and the cleaning tank is now empty and

### Nyrex start-up procedure

1. Open valves on the suction and discharge side of the ejector pump.
2. Open overboard valve for combined brine/air ejector.
3. Close vacuum relief valve which is on top of the Nirex shell.
4. Start ejector pump to create a vacuum.
5. Check that no water is visible in sight glass on separator. Continue when the vacuum reaches at least 90%.
6. Open steam to heater if not on jacket water.
7. Open the hot water inlet and outlet valves.
8. Start the hot water supply to distiller by adjusting the bypass valve until the desired jacket water temperature is reached. The boiling temperature now rises, while the vacuum drops to approximately 85%. Water flow can be seen in the air suction sight glass. This indicates that evaporation has started.
9. Open the valve to freshwater tank.
10. Switch on the salinometer.
11. Start the freshwater pump.


### Nyrex shut down procedure

1. Secure the steam supply to the plate heat exchanger.
2. Let hot water pump run for about five minutes, then secure.
3. Stop the freshwater pump.
4. Switch off salinometer.
5. Stop the ejector pump.
6. Open vacuum relief valve on the separator shell.
7. Close inlet and outlet valves for ejector pump.
8. Close outlet valve for combined brine/air ejector.

###  Recommended Turbogenerator Startup Procedure (T.S. Kennedy Specific) 

**Make preliminary checks**

  1. Check the unit over for operational readiness i.e. no loose gear, all maintenance completed, strainers clean, manhole covers on, zincs intact, etc.
  2. Check the oil in the sump. The oil should be at the high mark on the dipstick, in good condition, uncontaminated with water or sludge, and at least 60° F, preferably higher. It can be cleaned and heated via the centrifugal purifier, if necessary.
  3. Ensure that the console operated pneumatic valve which controls steam to the generator throttle is closed, and that the generator circuit breaker is open.

**Establish cooling water flow through the condenser**

  1. Open the motorized auxiliary circulating pump high or low suction valve. Use the high suction in port.
  2. Open the motorized overboard discharge valve.
  3. Open the butterfly valve to condenser shell.
  4. Open the butterfly valve to the duplex strainer for the L.O. cooler and the generator air cooler.
  5. Start the auxiliary circulating pump. The discharge pressure should be 7-12 psig. 
  6. Open the auxiliary circ. pump discharge globe valve. Starting a centrifugal pump before opening its discharge valve is good engineering practice, because it reduces the starting load on the drive motor; however, this practice is not always followed.
  7. Use the cooler inlet valves to restrict the cooling water flow to the generator LO cooler and air box cooler until they reach normal operating temperatures. (Normal: 110° F oil temperature at the LO cooler outlet, and 40° C generator air box temperature.

**Establish cooling water flow through the auxiliary air ejector**

Before the turbine is started and when it is operating under low loads, there is insufficient condensate to condense the air ejector steam. Condensate must be recirculated to supply sufficient coolant.

  1. Line up the condensate pump suction through the cone strainer, and discharge to the auxiliary air ejector condenser. (Three suction and two discharge valves on TSE).
  2. Open pump casing vent valves (Two on TSE).
  3. Open pump sealing water supply valve.
  4. Start the condensate pump, and open the condensate pump discharge valve. 
  5. Open the recirc. regulator hand bypass valve from the outlet of the air ejector about one turn.
  6. Watch the level in the hotwell, and adjust the recirc flow to keep the level low in the sight glass. If the recirc valve is opened too wide, the hotwell will flood and the DC heater level will fall.

**Start the Hydraulic Pressure Unit (HPU)**

The Woodward speed control governor requires an external oil supply at a pressure of approximately 150 psig to operate the steam throttle valves. The HPUs are located on the lower level, starboard side.

  1. Check the sump oil level of the HPU for the SSTG to be started.
  2. Start either pump 1 or pump 2.
  3. Place the selector in _auto_, which will place the other pump in standby mode.
  4. Check the differential gage on the duplex discharge strainer when unit is running. One to two psig is normal.

**Establish lubrication for turbine and reduction gears**

There are thee separate lube oil pumps on the unit: a hand operated rotary pump, an attached IMO pump which is driven off the reduction gear, and a motor driven auxiliary oil pump. The turbogenerator sump holds 140 gallons of 2190-TEP oil. Additional oil can be added via the purifier, or by hand through the sump fill plug near the dipstick. The unit also has a duplex strainer that should be cleaned and changed daily.

  1. Start the auxiliary oil pump.
  2. Check pump discharge pressure: it should be about 90 psig. Oil pressure will open the steam throttle trip valve.
  3. Check oil pressure to the bearings: it should be 10-15 psig.
  4. Check bull's eyes for oil flow from all bearings.

**Line up steam supply**

The generators are supplied with superheated steam at 600 psi, 850°F through a manual turbogenerator steam stop at each boiler, and a manual stop valve and a console operated pneumatic valve at each generator. Steam lines should always be drained and warmed up before admitting steam to a turbine.

  1. Open the three steam traps on the turbogenerator.
  2. Open the steam stop valves at the generator. 
  3. Open the generator stop valves at the port and/or starboard boiler.
  4. Open the drain before the control valve to the bilge slowly.

**Raise vacuum**

Note that each auxiliary air ejector is duplex: two complete sets of first and second stage ejector nozzles. Only one is normally used at a time.

  1. Line up vapor path: open first stage suction from condenser, second stage suction from intercondenser.
  2. Line up air ejector drains: Open inter condenser loop seal drain line to the auxiliary condenser. There is no valve in after condenser drain line to the atmospheric drain tank.
  3. Open 150 psi steam to the gland seal regulator and adjust it to 1.5 to 2.5 psig.
  4. Admit 150 psi steam to second stage air ejector nozzle. When the condenser vacuum reaches approximately 20 inches Hg, admit steam to the first stage. The vacuum should rise to 28-29 inches Hg.
  5. Adjust the recirc flow to maintain a condensate temperature of 90 to 125° F at the outlet from the air ejector condenser.

The turbine should be started spinning without delay after the vacuum is established to prevent the rotor from standing still in a hot environment, which would cause the rotor to bow and cause vibrations. Delaval recommends leaving the gland seal steam off until turbine is spinning to lessen the chance of rotor bowing.

**Idle and warm up the turbine**

  1. On the console: 

    1. Set _voltage regulator_ control to OFF.
    2. Set IDLE-RATED selector to IDLE. This will set the speed governor set point to the idle speed of 2900 rpm.
    3. Set selector to RUN. 
    4. Manually reset lube oil trip on front end of turbogenerator by pulling up on the round knob.
    5. Open pneumatically controlled steam valve using the pneumatic steam stop valve control knob located on the main console.
    6. Press the green start bypass button. The unit should start and run at approximately 2900 rpm. 

  2. Walk around the generator and check for any problems such as water or lube oil leaks, unusual noises, etc. If in doubt, shut the unit down.

**Bring the turbine up to speed**

  1. Allow the turbine to idle for about 30 minutes if possible, or at least until the oil temperature reaches 90°F. The generator should not be run above idle speed until the lube oil temperature reaches 90° F.
  2. Set IDLE-RATED selector switch to START. This sets the governor set point to the rated speed.
  3. Open the pneumatic valve fully: 71 psig air pressure. The turbine speed should rise and then stabilize at 10,012 rpm as the governor takes control.
  4. Set the voltage regulator control to AUTOMATIC.

**Watch the unit carefully**

  * Keep your eye on the vacuum, oil pressure and temperature, air box temperature, and condensate temperature.
  * Start cooling water to the lube oil cooler when the oil temperature comes up, and adjust to maintain 110° F.
  * Adjust the cooling water flow to the air box to maintain 40° C.
  * Adjust or secure recirc as necessary to maintain condensate temperature and hotwell level.

When you are satisfied with the operation of the turbo-generator, you can put it on the line.

###  Recommended Turbogenerator Startup Procedure (T.S. Kennedy Specific) 

**Make preliminary checks**

  1. Check the unit over for operational readiness i.e. no loose gear, all maintenance completed, strainers clean, manhole covers on, zincs intact, etc.
  2. Check the oil in the sump. The oil should be at the high mark on the dipstick, in good condition, uncontaminated with water or sludge, and at least 60° F, preferably higher. It can be cleaned and heated via the centrifugal purifier, if necessary.
  3. Ensure that the console operated pneumatic valve which controls steam to the generator throttle is closed, and that the generator circuit breaker is open.

**Establish cooling water flow through the condenser**

  1. Open the motorized auxiliary circulating pump high or low suction valve. Use the high suction in port.
  2. Open the motorized overboard discharge valve.
  3. Open the butterfly valve to condenser shell.
  4. Open the butterfly valve to the duplex strainer for the L.O. cooler and the generator air cooler.
  5. Start the auxiliary circulating pump. The discharge pressure should be 7-12 psig. 
  6. Open the auxiliary circ. pump discharge globe valve. Starting a centrifugal pump before opening its discharge valve is good engineering practice, because it reduces the starting load on the drive motor; however, this practice is not always followed.
  7. Use the cooler inlet valves to restrict the cooling water flow to the generator LO cooler and air box cooler until they reach normal operating temperatures. (Normal: 110° F oil temperature at the LO cooler outlet, and 40° C generator air box temperature.

**Establish cooling water flow through the auxiliary air ejector**

Before the turbine is started and when it is operating under low loads, there is insufficient condensate to condense the air ejector steam. Condensate must be recirculated to supply sufficient coolant.

  1. Line up the condensate pump suction through the cone strainer, and discharge to the auxiliary air ejector condenser. (Three suction and two discharge valves on TSE).
  2. Open pump casing vent valves (Two on TSE).
  3. Open pump sealing water supply valve.
  4. Start the condensate pump, and open the condensate pump discharge valve. 
  5. Open the recirc. regulator hand bypass valve from the outlet of the air ejector about one turn.
  6. Watch the level in the hotwell, and adjust the recirc flow to keep the level low in the sight glass. If the recirc valve is opened too wide, the hotwell will flood and the DC heater level will fall.

**Start the Hydraulic Pressure Unit (HPU)**

The Woodward speed control governor requires an external oil supply at a pressure of approximately 150 psig to operate the steam throttle valves. The HPUs are located on the lower level, starboard side.

  1. Check the sump oil level of the HPU for the SSTG to be started.
  2. Start either pump 1 or pump 2.
  3. Place the selector in _auto_, which will place the other pump in standby mode.
  4. Check the differential gage on the duplex discharge strainer when unit is running. One to two psig is normal.

**Establish lubrication for turbine and reduction gears**

There are thee separate lube oil pumps on the unit: a hand operated rotary pump, an attached IMO pump which is driven off the reduction gear, and a motor driven auxiliary oil pump. The turbogenerator sump holds 140 gallons of 2190-TEP oil. Additional oil can be added via the purifier, or by hand through the sump fill plug near the dipstick. The unit also has a duplex strainer that should be cleaned and changed daily.

  1. Start the auxiliary oil pump.
  2. Check pump discharge pressure: it should be about 90 psig. Oil pressure will open the steam throttle trip valve.
  3. Check oil pressure to the bearings: it should be 10-15 psig.
  4. Check bull's eyes for oil flow from all bearings.

**Line up steam supply**

The generators are supplied with superheated steam at 600 psi, 850°F through a manual turbogenerator steam stop at each boiler, and a manual stop valve and a console operated pneumatic valve at each generator. Steam lines should always be drained and warmed up before admitting steam to a turbine.

  1. Open the three steam traps on the turbogenerator.
  2. Open the steam stop valves at the generator. 
  3. Open the generator stop valves at the port and/or starboard boiler.
  4. Open the drain before the control valve to the bilge slowly.

**Raise vacuum**

Note that each auxiliary air ejector is duplex: two complete sets of first and second stage ejector nozzles. Only one is normally used at a time.

  1. Line up vapor path: open first stage suction from condenser, second stage suction from intercondenser.
  2. Line up air ejector drains: Open inter condenser loop seal drain line to the auxiliary condenser. There is no valve in after condenser drain line to the atmospheric drain tank.
  3. Open 150 psi steam to the gland seal regulator and adjust it to 1.5 to 2.5 psig.
  4. Admit 150 psi steam to second stage air ejector nozzle. When the condenser vacuum reaches approximately 20 inches Hg, admit steam to the first stage. The vacuum should rise to 28-29 inches Hg.
  5. Adjust the recirc flow to maintain a condensate temperature of 90 to 125° F at the outlet from the air ejector condenser.

The turbine should be started spinning without delay after the vacuum is established to prevent the rotor from standing still in a hot environment, which would cause the rotor to bow and cause vibrations. Delaval recommends leaving the gland seal steam off until turbine is spinning to lessen the chance of rotor bowing.

**Idle and warm up the turbine**

  1. On the console: 

    1. Set _voltage regulator_ control to OFF.
    2. Set IDLE-RATED selector to IDLE. This will set the speed governor set point to the idle speed of 2900 rpm.
    3. Set selector to RUN. 
    4. Manually reset lube oil trip on front end of turbogenerator by pulling up on the round knob.
    5. Open pneumatically controlled steam valve using the pneumatic steam stop valve control knob located on the main console.
    6. Press the green start bypass button. The unit should start and run at approximately 2900 rpm. 

  2. Walk around the generator and check for any problems such as water or lube oil leaks, unusual noises, etc. If in doubt, shut the unit down.

**Bring the turbine up to speed**

  1. Allow the turbine to idle for about 30 minutes if possible, or at least until the oil temperature reaches 90°F. The generator should not be run above idle speed until the lube oil temperature reaches 90° F.
  2. Set IDLE-RATED selector switch to START. This sets the governor set point to the rated speed.
  3. Open the pneumatic valve fully: 71 psig air pressure. The turbine speed should rise and then stabilize at 10,012 rpm as the governor takes control.
  4. Set the voltage regulator control to AUTOMATIC.

**Watch the unit carefully**

  * Keep your eye on the vacuum, oil pressure and temperature, air box temperature, and condensate temperature.
  * Start cooling water to the lube oil cooler when the oil temperature comes up, and adjust to maintain 110° F.
  * Adjust the cooling water flow to the air box to maintain 40° C.
  * Adjust or secure recirc as necessary to maintain condensate temperature and hotwell level.

When you are satisfied with the operation of the turbo-generator, you can put it on the line.
