The sea term provides an opportunity for cadets to obtain sea service as an officer in charge of a navigational watch. Shipboard training is closely integrated with the shore-based academic curriculum at the Academy. Focusing on all aspects of shipboard operations, the Junior Sea Term is an opportunity for the marine transportation cadet to explore the vessel and learn its systems. The cadet will then utilize that information while assisting in the operation of the vessel and while standing watches. The commercial sea term project is used to determine the sea term III grade.

This course consists of an approximately 52-day long shipboard experence on the training vessel including watchstanding, maintenance and training.

This laboratory supports the Electronics course (EN-3212). Participants learn to use electronic instruments by taking measurements on analog and digital circuits constructed during the lab period. The measurements are then used to verify the analytical relationships developed in the classroom.

This course consists of Twelve 2-hour laboratories and a project or report.


### Learning Objectives



### Topics

* Breadboards and passive components
* Power supplies, diodes, oscilloscopes and switches
* Voltage dividers, Wheatstone Bridge
* Rectifiers

* Stroboscope
* And gates
* Filters
* Operational Amplifiers
* Inverting summers
* Logic circuits and master control relay
* Programmable logic controllers
* Comparators
* Comparator and logic design project
* Third-order filters and op-amp isolation

This lab is counted towards workshop skills for STCW purposes.
