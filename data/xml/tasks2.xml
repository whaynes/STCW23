</td><td markdown='1'>

The candidate starts and shuts down a reverse osmosis plant as follows: 

Reverse-osmosis unit start-up procedure

1. Performs a cursory examination of the plant to ensure that the system is intact, that all components are fully assembled, and that the unit is in a state of operational readiness;

2. Ensures that all pre-filter, media filter and cartridge filter drain and vent valves are closed;

3. Opens all sea water valves from the sea chest up to the unit, the sea water inlet cock valve, and the feed water pump isolation valves if the unit is so equipped;

4. Positions the 3-way feed/rinse/clean/store valve to the normal feed position and lines up the media filter isolation, back-flush, and waste outlet valve for normal operation;

5. Positions the 3-way media filter outlet valve to the normal feed position to the cartridge pre-filters;

6. Opens the back pressure regulator bypass valve fully and completely backs off on the back pressure regulator valve;

7. Positions the 3-way brine discharge/rinse/clean/store valve to the normal overboard position and ensures that all the brine discharge valves to the overboard skin valve are all open;

8. Ensures that electrical power is established to the unit by closing the appropriate circuit breaker;

9. Checks oil level in high pressure pump crankcase, and adds oil as necessary;

10. Places feed pump and feed booster pump switches in the automatic mode as appropriate if so equipped;

11. Depresses the unit salinity controller start switch, observes feed pump, booster feed pump, and high pressure pump pressures and feed flow meter, bleeds air from pre-filter, media filter, and cartridge pre-filters as needed, and checks for system leaks;

12. Once proper feed has been established, slowly closes the back pressure regulator bypass valve, and closes in on back pressure regulator until manufacturer recommended design pressure is reached for the existing sea water salinity, and observes fresh water product flow meter;

13. Lines up fresh water system valves to permit delivery of fresh water to the fresh water storage tank on service and monitors the salinity of the fresh water product;

14. Ensures that an acceptable salinity is eventually reached on fresh water product and that the 3-way fresh water product diverting valve switches from the overboard discharge to the fresh water delivery mode; and

15. Monitors system, pressures, flows, and salinity to ensure that parameters remain within acceptable limits.

 Reverse-osmosis unit procedure for short term shut-down 

1. Depresses the unit salinity controller stop switch and ensures that the feed pump, booster feed pump, and high pressure pump all stop rotating and that their respective indicator lights go out;

2. Closes all sea water valves from the sea chest up to the unit, the sea water inlet cock valve, and the feed water pump isolation valves if the unit is so equipped;

3. Opens any valves in the cleaning tank discharge line to the unit 3-way feed feed/rinse/clean/store valve;

4. Positions the 3-way feed/rinse/clean/store valve to the rinse position and lines up the media filter isolation, back-flush, and waste outlet valve for normal operation;

5. Ensures that multi-media filter and cartridge pre-filter drain valves are closed;

6. Opens the back pressure regulator bypass valve, and backs off on the back pressure regulator valve fully to release the pressure from the unit;

7. Ensures that the 3-way brine/clean/store/rinse valve is in the normal brine discharge position;

8. Fills the cleaning tank with chlorine free product fresh water;

9. Places the booster pump control switch to the “hand” position and observes the feed flow meter;

10. When the feed flow meter indicates no flow (and the cleaning tank is now empty and short-term rinsing is complete), places the booster pump to the “off” position, then “auto”; and

11. Secures electrical power to the unit by opening the appropriate circuit breaker.

The candidate:

1. Obtains the necessary schematics and wiring diagrams;

2. Verifies that any necessary circuit breakers and disconnects switches supplying power to the motor and associated control equipment are closed as appropriate;

3. Using a voltmeter, checks for power available at the service entrance of the controller and verifies that all supply voltages are within accepted parameters;

4. Tests power and control fuses using on-line testing techniques with a voltmeter - to verify the results, tests the fuses off-line with an ohmmeter;

5. If fuses are blown, visually checks for obvious signs of electrical shorts and grounds;

6. Visually checks the interior of the controller enclosure for any signs of overheating, burning of contacts, weak contactor springs, corroded magnetic contactor armature faces, discoloration of terminals and conductors, broken conductors, loose fuses, and loose terminal connections; also uses sense of smell to check for burned insulation;

7. Restores power and attempts to restart the motor while observing the motor controller to determine what relays and contactors are pulling in, if any;

8. If the motor contactor is pulling in:

     a. Listens for any buzzing or chattering noises;

     b. Using a voltmeter, checks for voltage drops and imbalances; and

     c. Using a clamp-on ammeter, checks for current draws and imbalances in the power circuit lines; verifies normal current by checking the motor nameplate data;

9. If the motor contactor is not pulling in:

     a. Determines what actions in terms of motor controller load energization (such as relays, timers, contactors, indicator lights, etc., if any, do take place; and

     b. Using the control schematic, determines what specific operating contacts are necessary for energizing specific operating contactor and relay coils for normal motor startup;

10. After closing any required operating contacts, checks to see if normal voltage is applied to the operating coil. If:

     a. Normal voltage is being applied to the operating coil, tests the coil resistance with an ohmmeter, ensuring first that power is secured to the controller and coil is properly isolated;

     b. No voltage at all is being applied to the operating coil, determines the location of the open in the control circuit;

     c. An unacceptably low voltage is being applied to the operating coil, determines the location of the partial open in the control circuit.; and

11. Verifies on-line results for low or no voltage by testing operating contacts for continuity using off-line testing with an ohmmeter. Ensures that power is secured to the controller and operating contacts are properly isolated before testing.

2. Determines through visual inspection if leakage of pumped fluid is dripping at an acceptable rate;

3. Determines (for saltwater cooling service) if leakage is cool to the touch;

4. Determines by using a set of dividers if packing is evenly distant from casing;

5. Tightens packing gland by turning both packing gland nuts by a 1⁄4-turn before additional tightening to maintain a parallel position of the gland with the casing;

6. Looks for a reduction in leakage and ascertains by touch if the leakage has become warmer;

7. Continues tightening of the packing gland until the leakage is reduced to a continuous dribble and/or the leakage has begun to warm; and

8. Notifies the senior engineer if leakage flow is not stemmed and/or the leakage has warmed excessively.
