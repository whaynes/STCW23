##Trouble Spots

### Renaming Things

* When a field is renamed in filemaker, the corresponding xslt will need to be modified.
* Renaming a course, assessment, table etc may leave old files present in html folder or on web server.  Need to clean them out, or you may end up with accidental links to staLe pages.

### Frontier Glossary Issues

* Glossary links can't contain hyphens, periods, slashes, and maybe others and they must be stripped out when building links
