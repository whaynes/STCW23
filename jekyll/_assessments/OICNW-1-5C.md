Note the vessel's magnetic compass heading while aligned on the range and determine magnetic compass deviation.
{% endcapture %}
{{ behavior | markdownify }}

</td><td>

{% capture standard %}
1. The magnetic heading is compared to the charted range bearing.
2. The magnetic compass error is determined and properly labeled.
3. Variation is determined from the chart.
4. The deviation solution is ± 2° of the assessor’s solution.
5. The deviation is correctly recorded in the compass record book.
