### Course Description

Lays the foundation for future marine engineering courses. It covers the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of piping systems, fittings, joints, packing, and valves including basic control valves. Basic pressure, temperature, and level measurements and instruments are also discussed. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester, six 3-hour labs with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.
