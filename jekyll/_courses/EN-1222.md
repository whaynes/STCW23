### Course Description

The course provides the operating engineering foundation for future facilities engineering courses. It covers the installation, operation, maintenance, and repair of equipment found in todayâ€™s modern facilities. The use of different hand tools, fasteners, and measuring instruments are discussed, along with the repair of piping systems, fittings, joints, packing, valves, and basic control valves. Varieties of pressure, temperature, and level indication are also discussed. The lab makes use of on-campus operating facilities and introduces students to on-campus alternative and renewable energy systems. This course may be taken in lieu of {% course EN-1211 %}, *Auxiliary Machinery I*, and satisfies all STCW knowledge and practical elements of that course.

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester, six 3-hour labs with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.
