### Course Description

A continuation of {% course EN-1211 %} *Auxiliary Machinery I* and covers the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of basic power plant systems, steam traps, strainers, pumps, heat exchangers, condensers, air ejectors, deaerators, hydraulic systems and components, and air compressors and systems. The lab consists of CAD use to draw specific training ship systems; the use of cutaway equipment, operational trainers, and simulators; and the use of actual shipâ€™s equipment to enhance the understanding of material presented in the course. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester, six 4-hour labs with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.
