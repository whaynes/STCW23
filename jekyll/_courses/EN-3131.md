### Course Description

Covers the design, construction, and operation of steam generators (boilers). It also considers fuels and their combustion, combustion equipment, combustion control, feedwater regulators, air heaters, economizers, superheaters, reheaters, boiler water treatment, and auxiliary boilers. A lab aboard the Academyâ€™s training ship is included, emphasizing boiler external fittings, safety valves, fuel oil systems, and main and auxiliary steam systems. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester, six 3-hour labs with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.
