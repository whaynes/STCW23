### Course Description

This laboratory supports the Electronics course (EN-3212). Participants learn to use electronic instruments by taking measurements on analog and digital circuits constructed during the lab period. The measurements are then used to verify the analytical relationships developed in the classroom.

This course consists of Twelve 2-hour laboratories and a project or report.
