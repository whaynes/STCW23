### Course Description

A study of the principles of industrial measurement and control with an emphasis on practical applications aboard ship and in industry. Methods of sensing, measuring and transmitting data from industrial processes; feedback, automatic control systems, closed loop systems, controllers, control modes, and control configurations. Mechanical, electronic, analog and digital control mechanism will be discussed, as will programmable logic controllers.

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester and a comprehensive final exam.
