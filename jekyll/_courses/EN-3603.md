### Course Description

Covers instrumentation and control fundamentals and applications to facility systems including documentation. Both analog and digital control systems are covered. It is also an introduction to programmable logic controllers.

This course may be taken in lieu of [EN-3216](EN-3216), *Operational Controls*, and satisfies all STCW knowledge and practical elements of that course.

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester and a comprehensive final exam.
