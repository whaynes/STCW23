### Course Description

Studies diesel engine systems and various methods of application. Engine operation, installation, and maintenance are also considered, as well as diesel engine drive trains and torque conversion. The lab is divided between shipboard systems and the diesel lab ashore. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester, six 6-hour labs  with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.
