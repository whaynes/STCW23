### Course Description

The course includes general naval architecture nomenclature, geometry, hydrostatic curves,  longitudinal stability calculations, identification of principal structural members, and calculations for ship strength curves. The course also studies resistance relationships between an actual ship and a ship model, ship propulsion design requirements, and sizing of a shipâ€™s engine and power plant.

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester and a comprehensive final exam.

### Entrance requirements

* Draw free body diagrams, and solve for forces acting on an object
* Determine stresses, strains and bending moments
* Calculate centroids and moments of inertia
* Draw shear and bending moment diagrams for a beam under different conditions of loading
* Apply principles of fluid mechanics to find the forces on a submerged object
* Be familiar with ship's nomenclature, ship's propulsion methods, and the parts of a ship
