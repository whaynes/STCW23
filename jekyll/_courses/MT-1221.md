### Course Description

This course introduces a student to the knowledge and practices necessary to carry out routine day to day navigational watchkeeping duties in a proper and safe manner.  The student will be able to understand and read information from a chart; fix the ship’s position in coastal waters; understand earth’s magnetism; comprehend buoyage systems; and check and compare magnetic and gyro compasses, obtaining and applying compass error.  In addition, the student will be introduced to the basic concepts and obtain an understanding of electronic navigation aids, Global Positioning System and Radar.  Classwork is supplemented by practical chart plot exercises in weekly labs including time in the Electronic and Navigation Lab (ENL) or Integrated Navigation Lab (INL) simulator with students working in teams of two at each student station.  Note:  A student who fails twice to receive a minimum C- grade will be disenrolled from the Marine Transportation degree program. [Lab time required]


This course consists of two 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with a comprehensive final examination.
