### Course Description

A basic knowledge of ship construction and design, the principal structural members of a ship, and the proper nomenclature for the various components are taught in this course. Construction materials and fabrication techniques will be studied. Students will be taught to sue ship’s plans and the deadweight scale to extract pertinent data. The history of ship development will be discussed, with a focus on the various tonnages used as a measurement of a ship’s size and capacity. Common loading conditions and terms will be taught and proved a base of knowledge for discussion in other courses and use in related maritime industries.

This course consists of three 1-hour lectures a week for a semester with a comprehensive final examination.
