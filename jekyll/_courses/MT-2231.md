### Course Description

This course teaches marlinspike, lifesaving and safety equipment, advanced fire fighting techniques, use of deck machinery, boat handling, and watchstanding procedures for deck and/or bridge watchkeeping. Students will be able to apply these skills appropriately when in charge of a navigational watch. Course consists of classroom and practical experience on *T.S. Kennedy* and Academy small boats. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with practrical assessments and a comprehensive final examination.
