### Course Description

Provides an opportunity for cadets to obtain sea service as an officer in charge of a navigational watch in a structured shipboard training program. The training uses a building block approach, bringing the cadet up to an acceptable level of proficiency in each area of required competence. Shipboard training is closely integrated with the shore-based academic curriculum at the Academy. The Sophomore Sea Term focuses upon all facets of shipboard operations and provides cadets an opportunity to practice terrestrial navigation skills.



This course consists of an approximately 52-day long shipboard experence on the training vessel including watchstanding, maintenance and training.
