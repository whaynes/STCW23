### Course Description

This course gives a basic understanding of meteorology, and its application to shipboard operations. The student will have a knowledge of meteorological instruments and their application, knowledge of the characteristics of various weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems, and the ability to apply the meteorological information available. Students will complete a practical assessment of reading and interpreting weather charts and demonstrate the ability to forecast future weather events. In addition, the knowledge gained in this subject will serve as the basis for further training to the level of Chief Mate and Master.

This class may be live-streamed from Massachusetts Maritime Academy (MMA) to students taking the course at Shanghai Maritime Academy (SMU) in Shanghai, China.

This course consists of three 1-hour lectures a week for a semester with a comprehensive final examination.
