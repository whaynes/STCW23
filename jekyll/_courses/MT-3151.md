### Course Description

Within this course, the student will learn the characteristics, hazards and safe practices for the handling of petroleum and chemical products. During labs, students practice the actual loading of cargo/ballast aboard the Academy’s 40-foot tank barge. In the lab, using the liquid loading simulator, students practice loading, discharging and tank cleaning. This course satisfies the training requirements necessary for endorsements as tankerman-PIC, Tankerman-PIC (barge), Tankerman Assistant, and Tankerman-Engineer. Each student is issued a Tankship/Tankbarge Dangerous Liquid Cargo Certificate upon satisfactory completion of this course. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with a comprehensive final examination.
