### Course Description

This course is designed to meet all ARPA knowledge-based assessments and the fourteen performance-based assessments, which form part of the requirements for Officer in Charge of a Navigation Watch (STCW Table A-II/1). Students who successfully complete the course will be able to choose an appropriate mode of display, select plotting graphics controls suitable to the circumstances, make appropriate use of operational alarms, acquire and track those targets which present a potential threat of collision, extract the information needed on course, speed, and closest point of approach to enable early action and prevent a close-quarters situation, and use ARPA to confirm and monitor their actions. Students will be aware of the dangers of over reliance on automatic acquisition and tracking of targets and on operational alarms. They will also be aware of factors (including errors in course and speed inputs) which may affect accuracy and the correct functioning of the ARPA. This course satisfies the requirements for a USCG ARPA endorsement.  Class is held weekly in the Integrated Navigation Lab (INL) simulator with students working individually at each student station.  Classwork is supplemented by practical weekly labs in the Integrated Navigation Lab (INL) simulator with students working individually at each station. [Lab time required]


This course consists of one 1-hour lecture and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with practrical assessments and a comprehensive final examination.
