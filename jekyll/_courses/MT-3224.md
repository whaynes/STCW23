### Course Description

This course is designed to enhance navigational safety through the correct operation of ECDIS equipment by the officer in charge of a navigational watch. The integrated lecture/lab experience will allow each student to practice each required proficiency task on individual ECDIS/simulation stations as the topic is covered. Course content covers the theory of ECDIS, IMO regulations, and requirements and performance standards governing the use of ECDIS. This course meets the STCW requirements for ECDIS certification. [Lab time required]

This course consists of one 1-hour lecture and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with practrical assessments and a comprehensive final examination.


### STCW Objectives
