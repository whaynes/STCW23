### Course Description

Students will be taught to operate the radio communications required on board GMDSS-compliant vessels. Students will become proficient with GMDSS equipment and procedural operation along with developing a knowledge of radio wave propagation. The Electronic Navigation and GMDSS Solo courses contain all of the elements contained in the GMDSS model course developed in the United States. This course satisfies the requirements necessary to earn the STCW endorsement as a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System Operator. [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with a comprehensive final examination.
