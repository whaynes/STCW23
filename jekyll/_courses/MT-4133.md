### Course Description

A capstone assessment program allowing deck, undergraduate students an opportunity to demonstrate competency in Bridge Resource Management and Watchstanding for STCW and USCG licensing requirements. Students successfully completing these competencies are capable of undertaking all of the duties and responsibilities expected of a deck watchkeeping officer. Upon successful completion of this course, a U.S. Coast Guard approved certificate is issued certifying that the holder demonstrates appropriate competence in watchkeeping, bridge team management, and bridge resource management, meeting the standards prescribed by IMO/STCW and the U.S. Coast Guard.  [Lab time required]

This course consists of one 1-1/2-hour lecture and one 4 hour lab per week with practical assessments and a comprehensive final examination.
