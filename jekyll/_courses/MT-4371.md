### Course Description

Provides an opportunity for cadets to obtain sea service as an officer in charge of a navigational watch in a structured shipboard training program. The training uses a building-block approach bringing the cadet up to an acceptable level of proficiency in each area of required competence. Shipboard training is closely integrated with the shore-based academic curriculum at the Academy. Particularly focusing on watchstanding and celestial navigation, the senior cruise is an opportunity for the Marine Transportation cadet to put together all facets of shipboard operations and to utilize them while in charge of the vessel and watches.

This course consists of an approximately 52-day long shipboard experence on the training vessel including watchstanding, maintenance and training.
