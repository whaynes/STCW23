3. Lead the painter inside falls and outboard of all obstructions;
4. Remove slack and secure the painter well forward by a round turn and figure eights on the bitts;
5. Pass frapping lines around the falls after the tricing pendants have pulled the lifeboat into the side of the ship, and slack as needed during the boat's descent;
6. Let go tricing pendants; and
