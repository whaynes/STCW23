The candidate issues the following orders in proper sequence and verifies that they have been properly carried out:

1. Remove boat cover and securing lines; put in drain plugs if fitted, check fuel- and lube-oil levels, test engine, and make sure all rescue gear is aboard;
2. Check that the sea painter is properly attached;
3. Secure control lines (if fitted) at rescue boat bow and stem;
4. Check that the out drive has been lowered;
5. Swing the rescue boat to the embarkation position; and 
6. Lower the rescue boat to water. 

**NOTE:**  If it is unsafe or impractical for persons to ride the boat to the water, this component of the task may be simulated.
