</td><td markdown='1'>

The candidate:

1. Reads and understands all standing orders and special instructions and descriptions to the assessor are correct, complete, and indicate a clear understanding of the duties involved;

2. Identifies all work being performed on machinery and systems, and identifies and describes personnel involved and potential hazards in the engine room to the assessor completely and correctly with watch implications clearly explained;

3. Conducts a complete round of the plant, inspecting all equipment, machinery lubricating-oil levels, adding lube-oil as necessary, and recording all pertinent system, equipment and machinery pressures and temperatures, during the watch, including:

     a. Checking plant’s operational status;

     b. Checking gas generator RPM;

     c. Checking gas generator vibration;

     d. Checking gas generator inlet temperature and pressure;

     e. Checking power turbine RPM;

     f. Checking power turbine inlet temperature;

     g. Checking power turbine vibration;

     h. Checking power turbine exhaust temperature;

     i. Checking gas turbine bearings’ temperature and oil flow;

     j. Checking governor, turbine/reduction gear lube-oil sump levels;

     k. Checking the physical condition of pipes, tubing, and hoses for wear or leaks;

     l. Observing gas turbine lube-oil supply and scavenging temperatures;

     m. Observing gas turbine air intake and exhaust temperatures and pressures, including air-intake filter pressure drop, as appropriate;

     n. Checking start air pressure;

     o. Reading and recording fuel-oil meter and day-tank levels;

     p. Observing and recording the sea temperature;

     q. Sounding and recording the bilge-water holding tank;

     r. Observing the stern-tube supply pump discharge pressure and temperature;

     s. Checking or any unusual conditions or noises;

     t. Notifying the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions;

     u. Taking proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations;

     v. Ensuring that the engine-room and cargo-hold bilge wells have been de-watered according to level, draft, and heel of the vessel;

     w. Ensuring that all required entries have been appropriately made in the engine room log book; and

4. Answers maneuvering orders while in engine-room control mode.
