3. Checks gas turbine generator frequency;
4. Checks gas turbine generator output voltage;
5. Checks gas turbine generator output amperage;
6. Checks gas turbine generator kilowatt output;
7. Checks gas turbine generator kilovolt-amp reactive output or power factor, as appropriate;
8. Checks gas turbine generator bearings’ temperature and oil flow;
9. Checks governor, turbine/reduction gear lube-oil sump levels;
10. Checks the physical condition of pipes, tubing, and hoses for wear or leaks;
11. Observes gas turbine lube-oil and cooling-water temperatures and pressures;
12. Observes gas turbine air intake and exhaust temperatures and pressures, including air-intake filter pressure drop, as appropriate;
13. Checks start air pressure
14. Reads fuel-oil meter and day-tank levels;
15. Checks for any unusual conditions or noises;
16. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions; and
17. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
