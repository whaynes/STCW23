4. Checks turbo-generator output voltage;
5. Checks turbo-generator output amperage;
6. Checks turbo-generator kilowatt output;
7. Checks turbo-generator kilovolt-amp reactive output, or power factor;
8. Checks turbo-generator bearings’ temperature and oil flow;
9. Checks turbo-generator/reduction gear lube-oil sump levels;
10. Checks the physical condition of pipes, tubing, and hoses for wear or leaks;
11. Observes steam turbine lube-oil and cooling-water temperatures and pressures;
12. Observes auxiliary condenser vacuum and exhaust temperatures;
13. Observes level of condensate in auxiliary condenser hot well;
