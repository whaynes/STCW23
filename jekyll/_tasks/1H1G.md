The assessment applies to all RFPEW endorsements.

</td><td markdown='1'>

The candidate:

1. Correctly connects the compressed air hose from the service air header to the pressure tank;
2. Opens the appropriate valves, charge air into the pressure tank, while observing the water level and allowing the potable water pump to cycle on and off;
3. Closes the appropriate valves, secure from charging air into the pressure tank when the potable water pump no longer short- cycles and the pressure tank level cycles between normal parameters;
4. Correctly disconnects and stow the compressed air hose from the service air header to the pressure tank; and
5. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
