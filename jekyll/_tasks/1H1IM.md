The candidate:

1. Monitors the main lube-oil and cooling water temperatures entering and leaving the main lube-oil cooler;
2. Monitors the main lube-oil-sump or sump tank level
3. Monitors the main lubricating oil pump suction and discharge pressures, the lube-oil header supply pressure and any applicable filter or strainer pressure drop;
4. Monitors ancillary lube oil system parameters to include pressures, temperatures, and levels for systems to include crosshead, cam, rocker, and cylinder oil systems if applicable;
5. Monitors jacket water cooling pump suction and discharge pressures, jacket water system temperatures, pressures, and flow indicators, and expansion tanks levels;
6. Monitors ancillary specialized self-contained fresh water systems to include pressures, temperatures, and levels for systems to include injector and piston cooling water systems if applicable and inspects for oil contamination;
7. Monitors sea water cooling pump suction and discharge pressures, sea water system heat exchanger inlet and outlet temperatures, and sea strainer pressure drops;
8. Inspects fuel-injector leak-off piping, high-pressure delivery lines, and indicator cocks and checks for leakage;
9. Monitors fuel-oil booster and service pump suction and discharge pressures, fuel oil supply pressure and temperature, and any applicable strainer and filter pressure drops; 
10. Inspects fuel-oil temperature controller or viscosimeter set point as applicable;
11. Observes governor operation and lube-oil level,
12. Observes fuel-pump and /or fuel injector rack settings;
13. Observes telescopic links and cylinder lubrication, if fitted;
14. Checks operation of crankcase vacuum fans, mist detectors, and condition of explosion covers;
15. Monitors scavenging/charge air receiver pressures and temperatures as applicable;
16. Drains scavenging air receiver as applicable;
17. Monitors individual cylinder, turbocharger inlet and outlet exhaust temperatures and exhaust receiver pressures and temperatures as applicable;
18. Monitors reduction gear lube oil sump levels, lube oil temperatures and pressures, and lube oil filter and strainer pressure drops, if applicable;
19. Monitors controllable pitch propeller oil sump levels, pitch oil temperatures and pressures, and pitch oil filter and strainer pressure drops as applicable
20. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions, unusual sounds, or vibrations; and
21. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
