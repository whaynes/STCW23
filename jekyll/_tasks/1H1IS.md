Note 1

Not performing this task will limit the candidateâ€™s endorsement to motor and/or gas-turbine propelled vessels only.

This task is not required for steam propulsion and no limitation will be placed on the steam vessel endorsement if this task is not completed.

The candidate:

1. Monitors the main lube-oil and sea water temperatures entering and leaving the main lube-oil cooler;
2. Monitors the main lube-oil-sump level;
3. Monitors the main lube-oil-gravity tank for continuous overflow, as appropriate;
4. Monitors the lube oil pump suction and discharge pressures and lube-oil supply pressure to the main engines and applicable lube oil strainer pressure drops;
5. Monitors the oil-return temperature from each bearing and indicators for continuous flow;
6. Checks turbine rotor axial position indicator as applicable;
7. Checks turbine vibration indicator as applicable;
8. Monitors main condenser sea water inlet and outlet temperatures, main circulator pump suction and discharge pressures, and check water boxes for leaks;
9. Monitors main condensate suction and discharge pressures and main condenser hot well level;
10. Checks air-ejector equipment pressures and temperatures ;
11. Checks auxiliary exhaust steam pressure, shell pressure and water level in deaerating feed tank;
12. Monitors main condenser vacuum and turbine exhaust temperature;
13. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions, unusual sounds, or vibrations; and
14. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
