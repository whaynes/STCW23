The candidate:

1. Determines the need to take up on the gate or globe stuffing-box glands;
2. Checks for bent or scored stem;
3. Checks the valve for ease of operation, ensuring that it is a candidate for taking up on the gland without the necessity of adding packing or re-packing of the valve;
4. Checks the position of the gland to determine if it may be further tightened;
5. Tightens alternately each gland nut slightly and evenly until the stem-to-bonnet leakage ceases;
6. Inspects the gland to insure that it is square; and
7. Checks the valve for ease of operation ensuring that the operation is not unacceptably difficult.
