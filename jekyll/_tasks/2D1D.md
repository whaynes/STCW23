The candidate:

1. Takes two visual bearings of an approaching vessel using an azimuth circle, bearing circle, alidade, or other means resulting in equivalent accuracy, to determine if the bearing to the approaching vessel is appreciably changing, and each observation is within ± 2.0° of the assessor’s solution; and

2. Takes two electronic bearings of an approaching vessel using radar or ARPA, to determine if the bearing to the approaching vessel is appreciably changing, and each observation is within ± 2.0° of the assessor’s solution.
