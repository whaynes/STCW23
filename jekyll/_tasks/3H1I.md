Note 1

Not performing this task will limit the candidateâ€™s endorsement to motor and/or gas-turbine propelled vessels only.

This task is not required for steam propulsion and no limitation will be placed on the steam vessel endorsement if this task is not completed.

The candidate:

1. Ensures that permission has been requested from the bridge before blowing tubes;
2. Manually increases the de-aerating feedwater tank (DFT) level in preparation for using the steam soot blowers;
3. Verifies that the drain valve of the soot blower steam line is open;
4. Slowly opens the soot blower steam isolation valves;
5. Observes the output from the soot blower system drain, and secures the drain valve when it is determined that only steam is present;
6. Informs the OICEW when the system is ready;
7. Increases the speed of the forced-draft fan;
8. Physically pulls on any chain drive or manually rotates any crank to operate any non-air motor-driven soot blower in its proper sequence;
9. Assists in maintaining a watch on the main propulsion boiler water level, steam, pressure, and DFT water level;
10. At the end of cycling all soot blowers, secure the steam isolation valve to the soot blowers;
11. Opens the soot blower steam line drain; and
12. Wears proper safety equipment throughout the operation; and
13. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
