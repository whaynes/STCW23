     b. Failure of electrical power to all systems; and

2. Describes how to respond to scavenge fires, including:

     a. Stopping the engine;

     b. Shutting the fuel and air supply to the engine;

     c. Tightly closing the scavenge drains;

     d. After waiting the period of time specified by the engine manufacturer, thoroughly inspecting the engine's crankcase, trunking, cylinders, and pistons;

     e. Providing proper fire extinguishing elements such as carbon dioxide, dry powder, etc. to fight possible re-flash as a result of hot spots; and

     f. Making no attempt to immediately open the scavenge trunk or it might lead to a severe explosion – consults manufacturer’s instructions.
