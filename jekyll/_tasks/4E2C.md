     a. Checks all valves to ensure system is lined up for operation;

     b. Starts motor-driven cooling-water pump, if necessary;

     c. Ensures systems have adequate pressure and flow;

     d. Vents cooling-water heat exchangers, using the vent cocks or vent valves on the heat-exchanger shells;

     e. Re-checks water level in freshwater expansion tanks for adequacy; and

     f. Verifies above actions are indicated on the control panel;

2. Checks on lube-oil system;

     a. Checks that all valves and pumps are lined up for proper operation;
