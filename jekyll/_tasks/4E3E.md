2. Monitors necessary operational parameters, including:

     a. Reduction gear oil supply pressure and bearing temperatures;

     b. Power turbine and gas generator speeds and vibration levels;

     c. Compressor inlet  and discharge temperatures and pressures;

     d. Power turbine inlet temperature and pressure;

     e. Gas turbine bearing  lube oil temperatures; and

     f. Exhaust gas temperature and pressure;

3. Performs performance calculations and compares results with ideal mapping data; and

4. Determines necessary changes to operational procedures or status.
