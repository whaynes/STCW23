The candidate:

1. Explains the sequence of events that lead to the starting of at least two motor controllers; one reversing and one non- reversing;

2. Describes the basic operation of an electro-pneumatic or electro-hydraulic sequence system as chosen by the assessor; and

3. Lists the inherent dangers of High Voltage systems and enumerates special safety precautions to take when operating and troubleshooting such system.
