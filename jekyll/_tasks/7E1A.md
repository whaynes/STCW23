All

The assessment is required for all OICEW endorsements regardless of any limitations for propulsion mode and/or vessel equipment.

The candidate:

1. Correctly plans for and lays out the job, in proper sequence, and incorporates all safety considerations;

2. De-energizes the motor circuit;

3. Employs available mechanical means (e.g., fuse removal, circuit breaker box lock, etc.) to prevent unintentional energizing of the circuit;

4. Employs a sturdy tag device stating which circuit is de- energized, reason, date and time, and the person’s name who will be working on the motor;

5. Confirms that the system is de-energized and uses the Megger correctly in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions;

6. Corrects the reported resistance value for temperature and it is within +/- 5% of the assessor’s solution;

7. Correctly describes the actions as they are being performed; and

8. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
