2. Ensures that the logic path followed progressively eliminates or reduces possible grounding sources by: 

	a. Isolating the circuit breaker panel by sequentially opening each circuit feeder; 

	b. Isolating each circuit by opening each breaker in the panel until the circuit is found; and 

	c. If necessary, isolating each outlet/piece of equipment;
