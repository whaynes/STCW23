The candidate performs either A or B:

1. Using first one, then the other steering gear pump, alternately operates steering gear from maximum port to maximum starboard rudder from the ships wheel, non- follow up switches and local manual control devices;

2. On a running generator, not connected to the bus, shuts off valve to low LO shut down sensor;

3. With one steering gear motor running, interrupts power via circuit breaker on main switchboard to test if other unit starts automatically; and

4. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations. 

B)  *Z-Drive equipped vessel* 

Using each available steering pump, rotate the Z Drive unit in a 360-degree rotation within a period specified by the manufacturer; from the ships wheel/joystick, non-follow up switches and local manual control devices.
