The candidate:

1. Checks plant’s operational status;
2. Checks sea-water feed, brine, distillate, and sea water ejector pump suction and discharge pressures as appropriate;
3. Checks sea water feed inlet temperature;
4. Checks distillate outlet temperature;
5. Checks shell vacuum;
6. Checks jacket water heating inlet and outlet temperatures;
7. Verifies and checks distillate pump discharge to the proper tank;
8. Observes the position of the 3-way valve to ensure it is not tripped, unless in the case of high salinity;
9. Takes water-meter reading;
10. Checks distillate salinity; and
11. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions.
