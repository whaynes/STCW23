The candidate:

1. Reads and understands all standing orders and special instructions;

2. Identifies all work being performed and identifies and describes personnel involved and potential hazards in the engine room;

3. Conducts a complete periodic round of the plant, inspecting all equipment, machinery lubricating-oil levels and adding lube-oil as necessary;

4. Records all pertinent system, equipment and machinery pressures and temperatures during the watch;

5. Inspects and records:

     a. The level in the fuel oil settling tank;

     b. The level in main engine lube-oil sump, shipâ€™s service turbo generator sump, and lube-oil storage tanks are within minimum and maximum limits and notes any transfers in progress;

     c. The main boiler steam pressures and temperatures, forced draft fan pressures, uptake pressure and temperature, fuel-oil and feed pump discharge pressures, de-aerating feed tank pressure and temperature, condensate temperature, bleed steam pressures, etc;

     d. The available potable, make-up feed, and reserved feedwater tanks are within minimum and maximum limits and notes any transfers in progress;

     e. Refrigeration compressor suction and discharge pressures and temperatures; 

     f. Air conditioning compressor suction and discharge         pressures and temperatures, chill water cooler circulating         pump discharge pressure, and outlet and return         temperatures;

     g. That the potable water and sanitary systems hydro-         pneumatic tanks water level are at half-full and the air         charge is at the recommended pressure with the pump         cycled off;

     h. That the ship service system and control air compressor         lube-oil levels are within the normal range on the         dipstick, recording the each compressed air system         pressure;

     i. That the moisture from the compressed air systems         moisture separating device and air receivers are drained;

     j. Generator amps, kVA, and frequency;

     k. Lube-oil centrifuge oil input pressure and temperature;

     l. Waste-oil tank level;

     m. Saltwater evaporator feed, saltwater cooling and air         conditioning/refrigeration system saltwater supply pump         discharge pressures, if so equipped;

     n. Sea temperature;

     o. Bilge-water holding tank has been sounded and         recorded;

     p. Stern-tube supply pump discharge pressure and temperature;

     q. That the engine-room and cargo-hold bilge wells have been de-watered according to level, draft, and heel of the vessel; and

     r. That all required entries have been appropriately made in the engine room log book;

6. Answers maneuvering orders while in engine-room control mode; and

7. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
