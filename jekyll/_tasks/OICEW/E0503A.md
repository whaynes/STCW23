The candidate:

1. Checks plantâ€™s operational status;

2. Checks bilge-water tank level;

3. Checks oily-water-separator chamber pressure or vacuum;

4. Checks filling related pressure/vacuum;

5. Checks overboard-discharge water-pump pressure;

6. Monitors oil-content monitor and ensures that:

7. Equipment is not bypassed, sampling line is open, and flushing water is not being supplied to sensor;

8. Automatic valves are not operated in manual mode or disconnected from controlling  devices; and

9. No temporary hoses are used during operation and when possible, checks cleanliness of sensors;

10. Checks for any unusual conditions or noises;

11. Notifies watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions; and

12. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
