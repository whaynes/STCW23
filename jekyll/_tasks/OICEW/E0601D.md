### MMA Method

In order to satisfy  [NVIC 17-14  Task  6.1.D]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/nvic-17-14.pdf), MMA students must:

* Successfully complete MMA Assessment [OICEW-7-1E]({{site.baseurl}}/assessments/Engine/OICEW-7-1E) *Parallel generators*
* Successfully complete MMA Assessment [OICEW-7-1D]({{site.baseurl}}/assessments/Engine/OICEW-7-1D) *Connect ship service diesel generator to main switchboard*

The candidate takes the following actions, describing them as they are performed:

1. Ensures the plan reflects proper sequence of actions, is complete, and conforms to the requirements of manufacturer’s instructions and ship’s procedures;

2. Pre-inspects and starts the generator prime mover;

3. Verifies that automatic voltage regulator is at recommended voltage and manually adjusts as necessary;

4. Turns on synchroscope and observes direction and speed of rotation;

5. Manually adjusts generator speed so that the scope rotation is moving slowly in the “fast” direction;

6. Manually closes the in-coming unit’s circuit breaker to stop the synchroscope at the 12 o’clock position; turns off scope;

7. Divides load simultaneously and evenly between on-line and in-coming units by observing available switchboard meters;

8. Continues to shift load between unit to remain on-line and off- going unit, observing available switchboard meters;

9. Continues to manually reduce the off-going unit load until off- going unit circuit breaker trips, or trips breaker manually as the kW load of off-going unit approaches 0; and

10. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
