<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *steer 342*[^Note1]  and steady the vessel on the new course.



<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Turn the helm in the direction of the fewest degrees to the ordered course using no more than 15° of rudder;
3. Report the ship’s heading, while swinging, in each 10° increment;
4. Reduce the rudder angle as the vessel approaches the course;
5. Steady on the ordered course with less than 5° of overshoot; and
6. State: “Steady on course [ordered course].”

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command  *steer 342*[^Note2]  and  steer the vessel on course using the gyro-compass.



<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the helm order
2. When steady on course, state “Steering [three four two];” and
3. Steer the course ordered within ±3° (open ocean), and ±2° (near coastal) to demonstrate proficiency.

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Right (starboard) rudder*.

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turn the helm to right (starboard);
3. Stop turning the helm when the rudder angle indicator reads right (starboard) 10°;
4. State: “The rudder is right (starboard) 10°;” and
5. State the vessel’s heading in 10° increments until a new heading is provided (e.g., “passing 320°”).

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Left (port) rudder*.

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turn the helm to left (port);
3. Stop turning the helm when the rudder angle indicator reads left (port) 20°;
4. State: “The rudder is left (port) 20”, and
5. State the vessel’s heading in 10° increments until a new heading is provided (e.g., “passing 060°”).

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Rudder hard over*.

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turnsthe helm to right (starboard);
3. Stop turning the helm when the rudder angle indicator reads maximum right (starboard) rudder;
4. Ensure that the rudder is not jammed against the stops; and
5. State: “The rudder is hard right (starboard).”

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Ease the rudder* when the rudder is more than 5° right (starboard) or left (port).

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turn the helm  to reduce the rudder angle;
3. Stop turning the helm when the rudder angle indicator reads right (starboard) or left (port) 5°; and
4. State: “The rudder is right (starboard) or left (port) 5.”

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Midships the wheel* when the rudder is either right (starboard) or left (port).

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turn the helm to reduce the rudder angle;
3. Stop turning the helm when the rudder angle indicator reads zero; and
4. State: “The rudder is midships.”

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Shift your rudder* when the rudder is 15° right (starboard).

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turn the helm to the left (port);
3. Stop turning the helm when the rudder angle indicator reads left (port) 15°;
4. State: “The rudder is left (port) 15;” and
5. State the vessel’s heading in 10° increments until a new heading is provided (e.g., “passing 060°”).

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Meet her*  or,  *check her* during a turn.

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Immediately turn the helm  to reduce the rudder angle;
3. Apply counter rudder until the vessel stops turning;
4. Ease the wheel to midships; and
5. State: “The vessel’s heading is ...”

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command *Steady as She Goes*.

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeat the order;
2. Note the heading when the command was given;
3. Immediately apply counter rudder to stop any swing of the ship;
4. Steer the heading noted; and
5. State: “Steady, heading ...”

<!--rowend-->


<!--rowstart-->

Carry out the helm command, *Nothing to the right (starboard)*[^Note3] 

<!--cellbreak-->

1. Repeats the order;
2. Note the heading when the command was given;
3. Immediately apply counter rudder to stop any swing of the ship to the right (starboard); and
4. Steer the heading noted, but with no error to the right permitted.
