{{ "### Job Specifications [specs-oicew-1-1G]

Test shall be conducted in accordance with _ASTM Standard E1417 Visible Dye Penetrant Procedure (Type II Method C)_ or equivalent.

  1. Specimens should be visually examined for flaws before the application of penetrant.
  2. Specimens should be cleaned to remove contaminates that could prevent penetrant from entering discontinuities and thoroughly dried.
  3. Apply a thin, even coating of penetrant to the part by spraying.
  4. Allow the penetrant to dwell on the surface for 10 minutes or longer.
  5. Remove excess surface penetrant by wiping the surface with a dry lint-free cloth. Try to minimize the number of times the surface is wiped as each pass of the cloth could pull penetrant from a flaw.
  6. Finish the cleaning by dampening a cloth by spraying with solvent and wiping the surface one final time.
  7. Apply a light uniform coating of well agitated, non-aqueous wet developer by spraying. Excess developer will reduce the sensitivity of the inspection; this is the most common error made with liquid penetrants.
  8. Inspect the surface as the developer works to pull the penetrant from any surface breaking flaws to produce an indication. Allow the sample to develop for a minimum of 10 minutes.
  9. Record the location, size, orientation and other features of interest of any indications produced by the inspection.
  10. Clean all specimens by rinsing off the developer.
