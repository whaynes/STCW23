Title:  Changes to assessments
---

The following changes have been made to the engineering assessments to align them with the NVIC task, and clean up and simplify our assessment system.

## Changes

1. [OICEW-5-1E  *Shut down air compressor*](/stcw16/assessments/oicew51e.html) has been incorporated into [OICEW-5-1D  *Start and Secure Air Compressor*](OICEW-5-1D) and  eliminated as stand-alone.

2. The following have been incorporated into [OICEW-4-2A  *Respond to alarms*](OICEW-4-2A), and eliminated as stand-alone
    * OICEW-5-3B	*Respond to boiler high water alarm*
    * OICEW-5-3C	*Respond to boiler low water alarm*

3. The following have been incorporated into [OICEW-4-1D Monitor Engineering Machinery](OICEW-4-1D), and eliminated as stand-alone
    * [OICEW-9-1A	Monitor sanitary flushing water system ](/stcw16/assessments/oicew91a.html)
    * [OICEW-8-2G	Routine maintenance feed pump lube oil system ](/stcw16/assessments/oicew82g.html)
    * [OICEW-8-2H	Routine maintenance compressed air system](/stcw16/assessments/oicew82h.html)
    * [OICEW-5-3A	Check boiler water level ](/stcw16/assessments/oicew53a.html)


5.	Shipbard labs, not required by NVIC, we will continue to do them, but not track them as a assessments.  These activities may be replaced with others in the future.

    * [OICEW-8-2C](OICEW-8-2C) Gear pump maintenance
    * [OICEW-8-2D](OICEW-8-2D) Inspect valve manifold
    * [OICEW-8-2F](OICEW-8-2F) Overhaul heat exchanger
    * [OICEW-1-1D](OICEW-1-1D) Sweat joint
    * [OICEW-1-1E](OICEW-1-1E) Bend copper tube


6.	Three Elementary first aid assessments BFA-1,2 and 3, and three Advaned First Aid assessments AFA 1,2,and 3 have been eliminated and replaced with new assessments which align with the NVIC requirements.
