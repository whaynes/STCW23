### Electronics and Control Systems Lab

The lab supports both the Electronics Class (ECI-Electronics & Computer Integration), and the Instrumentation & Controls Class (INC).  It was developed, consolidated and renovated in 2008 from the two original Jack Donohoe spaces, and instrumented and activated in the Winter of 2009.  Here is the "mission statement" from one of my early proposals:

The new combined ECS Lab space will facilitate practical laboratory exercises to examine modern, internet-based hardware and software instrumentation through hands-on experience.

The combined lab/classroom supports both ECI & INC classes.  As you walk in, there are several hardware demonstration units in the window area to the left.  The white PLC unit is used for real-time ladder logic control demos in both ECI class and lab.  The boxed DC Servo & the Analog Controller unit are used for PID control demos in the INC Class.  I have detailed plans for future INC labs as part of the ABET program.  These labs will start with the existing PID analog control, and move into digital control using Matlab/Simulink software. 

The classroom area speaks for itself; there are 24 long format seats (only three rows provide better access to the students), and a digital projection system for detailed mutli-media instruction and real-time software demos.  By having the classroom within the combined area, easy access is enabled to the demonstration equipment and to show & tell hardware.  

The Electronics labs are conducted on the 6 main Lab Benches along the wall to your right as you enter.  There are two additional benches on the far wall that are used for setup, demonstrations, and outside project work.  In most of the actutual Electronics laboratories, the students build detailed breadboard circuits from schematics, and then calibrate the I/O using lab instrumentation (a copy of a current draft for bench equipment layout - using pictures - is attached).  

As far at STCW goes, while NOT an official STCW class, the ECI class covers most of the Electronics topics relevant to the USCG exam: RLC analog electronic circuits, block diagrams & closed-loop systems, transistors, passive & active filters, operational amplifiers (& Op-Amps for PID control), digital systems, comparators, ADCs & DACs, relay circuits, ladder logic, and programmable logic controllers with design applications (using PLCs with TECO-SG2 programming).
