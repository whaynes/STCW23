title: "STCW Definitions"
---




Some important terms are not actually defined in the STCW code, so for clarity here are the definitions used at MMA.


### Knowledge, understanding, and proficiency 

Ability
: The capacity to do something.

Skill
: A particular ability which improves with practice.

Knowledge
: Facts or information acquired by a person through experience or education.

Understanding
: Ability to use knowledge to perceive significance, draw conclusions, or make decisions.

Proficiency
: An ability requiring a combination of knowledge, understanding and skill to perform.

	 Some abilities are not proficiencies because they require little or no skill. They can be performed by an intelligent and able-bodied person without practice. Non-proficiencies do not normally need to be assessed, however if there is doubt that the candidate can actually perform the task, then they should be.
	
	 * *Proficiencies:* welding a pipe, using a sextant, making good decisions, troubleshooting.
	 * *Non-proficiencies:*  puting on gloves, pressing a button, climbing a ladder, answering the phone.

Competence (or competency)
:	Competence has two meanings
:	1) Fitness or ability to perform a certain task.  Example: She is a competent to draw blood from a patient. 
:	2) A work task or job function.  Example: The ability to draw blood is a competence all doctors must have.

	A candidate is deemed competent if he has demonstrated sufficient knowledge, understanding, and proficiency to perform the competences given in column 1 of the relevant STCW tables.
	
NVIC Task
:	A knowledge, understanding, or proficiency identified and numbered by the USCG, which is satisfied at MMA by either: 
:  1) completing a course which contains the knowledge or understanding, or 
:  2) completing a MMA practical assessment to demonstrate the proficiency, or
:  3) completing all elements of a relevant STCW table (e.g. firefighting, first aid).  

### Assessment of competence

Assessment
:  Assessment means the evaluation of evidence of a candidate's knowledge and abilities.  Assessment should be objective.  Evidence of *Knowledge* and *Understanding* may be provided by examination, while evidence of *Proficiency* is provided by practical demontration, job performance, or work products.  

Examination
: 	 An assessment whereby knowledge and understanding are verified by asking the candidate questions, including multiple-choice questions, either in writing or orally. Questions which begin with *define*, *list*, *describe*, *identify* and the like are sufficient to assess knowledge, while questions which begin with *why*, *explain*, or *what would you do if*, etc. can be used to assess understanding.  A student is considered to have demonstrated sufficient knowledge and understanding by achieving a 70 or higher final grade in the course where the knowledge and understanding are assessed.

Practical Demonstration	
: Practical demonstrations of skill are used to assess proficiency. Proficiency assessments must include a *Condition*, *Behavior*, and *Standard*.  At MMA, proficiency is assessed individually or in small teams when appropriate and is graded as pass/fail.   Cadets may repeat failed assessments with the permission of the assessor after remediation or additonal practice. 

Condition
: The condition describes the environment in which the assessment takes place; the relevant equipment, tools, procedures, materials, etc. available when the assessment is conducted.

Behavior
:  The behavior specifies the proficiency which the candidate must demonstrate.

Standard
:  The standard specifies the criteria for determining acceptable proficiency.

### Example

Condition
: On a basketball court with a standard ball and net.

Behavior
:  Shoot free throws for one minute.

Standard
:  Make at least five baskets.
