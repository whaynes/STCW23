title:  "Assessment Guidelines"
---


	

### Safety and environmental consideration

All procedures must be conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible fashion.  Personal protective equipment must be worn when required, lockout/tagout procedures followed, tools used properly, etc. All applicable environmental and polution prevention regulations must be followed. 

Students failing to demonstrate safe work practices or creating a hazardous situation will automatically receive a rating of **Failure, Below Standard** for the entire assessment.


### Uniform subtask performance criteria

Assessment criteria for tasks are defined in terms of subtasks shown below. Student performance will be compared to the subtask criteria outlined in these checklists.

### Performance standards


A student will be considered to be performing *at standard* and to have "passed" the assessment when a average score of 70 or greater is achieved using this rating scale on each element or subtask of the assessment criteria associated with a task.
