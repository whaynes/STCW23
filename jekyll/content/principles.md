**CHAPTER VIII**

**Standards regarding watchkeeping**

**Section A-VIII/1**

*Fitness for duty*

1\.  Administrations shall take account of the danger posed by fatigue of seafarers, especially those whose duties involve the safe and secure operation of a ship.

2\.  All persons who are assigned duty as officer in charge of a watch or as a rating forming part of a watch and those whose duties involve designated safety, prevention of pollution and security duties shall be provided with a rest period of not less than:

> .1 a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period; and  
> .2 77 hours in any 7-day period.

3\.  The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least 6 hours in length, and the intervals between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours.

4\.  The requirements for rest periods laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 need not be maintained in the case of an emergency or in other overriding operational conditions. Musters, fire-fighting and lifeboat drills, and drills prescribed by national laws and regulations and by international instruments, shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes the disturbance of rest periods and does not induce fatigue.

5\.  Administrations shall require that watch schedules be posted where they are easily accessible. The schedules shall be established in a standardized format in the working language or languages of the ship and in English.

6\.  When a seafarer is on call, such as when a machinery space is unattended, the seafarer shall have an adequate compensatory rest period if the normal period of rest is disturbed by call-outs to work.

7\.  Administrations shall require that records of daily hours of rest of seafarers be maintained in a standardized format, in the working language or languages of the ship and in English, to allow monitoring and verification of compliance with the provisions of this section. The seafarers shall receive a copy of the records pertaining to them, which shall be endorsed by the master or by a person authorized by the master and by the seafarers.

8\.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to impair the right of the master of a ship to require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the ship, persons on board or cargo, or for the purpose of giving assistance to other ships or persons in distress at sea. Accordingly, the master may suspend the schedule of hours of rest and require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary until the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after the normal has been restored, the master shall ensure that any seafarers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period are provided with an adequate period of rest.

9\.  Parties may allow exceptions from the required hours of rest in paragraphs 2.2 and 3 above provided that the rest period is not less than 70 hours in any 7-day period.

Exceptions from the weekly rest period provided for in paragraph 2.2 shall not be allowed for more than two consecutive weeks. The intervals between two periods of exceptions on board shall not be less than twice the duration of the exception.

The hours of rest provided for in paragraph 2.1 may be divided into no more than three periods, one of which shall be at least 6 hours in length and neither of the other two periods shall be less than one hour in length. The intervals between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours. Exceptions shall not extend beyond two 24-hour periods in any 7-day period.

Exceptions shall, as far as possible, take into account the guidance regarding prevention of fatigue in section B-VIII/1.

10\. Each Administration shall establish, for the purpose of preventing alcohol abuse, a limit of not greater than 0.05% blood alcohol level (BAC) or 0.25 mg/*l* alcohol in the breath or a quantity of alcohol leading to such alcohol concentration for masters, officers and other seafarers while performing designated safety, security and marine environmental duties.

**Section A-VIII/2**

*Watchkeeping arrangements and principles to be observed*

**PART 1 – CERTIFICATION**

**PART 4 – WATCHKEEPING AT SEA**

**Principles applying to watchkeeping generally**

9\.  Parties shall direct the attention of companies, masters, chief engineer officers and watchkeeping personnel to the following principles, which shall be observed to ensure that safe watches are maintained at all times.

10\. The master of every ship is bound to ensure that watchkeeping arrangements are adequate for maintaining a safe navigational or cargo watch. Under the master’s general direction, the officers of the navigational watch are responsible for navigating the ship safely during their periods of duty, when they will be particularly concerned with avoiding collision and stranding.

11\. The chief engineer officer of every ship is bound, in consultation with the master, to ensure that watchkeeping arrangements are adequate to maintain a safe engineering watch.

**Protection of marine environment**

12\. The master, officers and ratings shall be aware of the serious effects of operational or accidental pollution of the marine environment and shall take all possible precautions to prevent such pollution, particularly within the framework of relevant international and port regulations.

<a id='4-2'>***Part 4-2 – Principles to be observed in keeping an engineering watch***</a>

52\. The term *engineering watch* as used in parts 4-2, 5-2 and 5-4 of this section means either a person or a group of personnel comprising the watch or a period of responsibility for an officer during which the physical presence in machinery spaces of that officer may or may not be required.

53\. The *officer in charge of the engineering watch* is the chief engineer officer’s representative and is primarily responsible, at all times, for the safe and efficient operation and upkeep of machinery affecting the safety of the ship and is responsible for the inspection, operation and testing, as required, of all machinery and equipment under the responsibility of the engineering watch.

**Watch arrangements**

54\. The composition of the engineering watch shall, at all times, be adequate to ensure the safe operation of all machinery affecting the operation of the ship, in either automated or manual mode, and be appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.

55\. When deciding the composition of the engineering watch, which may include appropriately qualified ratings, the following criteria, *inter alia*, shall be taken into account:

> .1 the type of ship and the type and condition of the machinery;   
> .2 the adequate supervision, at all times, of machinery affecting the safe operation of the ship;   
> .3 any special modes of operation dictated by conditions such as weather, ice, contaminated water, shallow water, emergency conditions, damage containment or pollution abatement;   
> .4 the qualifications and experience of the engineering watch;   
> .5 the safety of life, ship, cargo and port, and protection of the environment;   
> .6 the observance of international, national and local regulations; and   
> .7 maintaining the normal operations of the ship.

**Taking over the watch**

56\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall not hand over the watch to the relieving officer if there is reason to believe that the latter is obviously not capable of carrying out the watchkeeping duties effectively, in which case the chief engineer officer shall be notified.

57\. The relieving officer of the engineering watch shall ensure that the members of the relieving engineering watch are apparently fully capable of performing their duties effectively.

62\. Any machinery not functioning properly, expected to malfunction or requiring special service shall be noted along with any action already taken. Plans shall be made for any further action if required.

63\. When the machinery spaces are in the manned condition, the officer in charge of the engineering watch shall at all times be readily capable of operating the propulsion equipment in response to needs for changes in direction or speed.

64\. When the machinery spaces are in the periodic unmanned condition, the designated duty officer in charge of the engineering watch shall be immediately available and on call to attend the machinery spaces.

65\. All bridge orders shall be promptly executed. Changes in direction or speed of the main propulsion units shall be recorded, except where an Administration has determined that the size or characteristics of a particular ship make such recording impracticable. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that the main propulsion unit controls, when in the manual mode of operation, are continuously attended under stand-by or manoeuvring conditions.

66\. Due attention shall be paid to the ongoing maintenance and support of all machinery, including mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic and pneumatic systems, their control apparatus and associated safety equipment, all accommodation service systems equipment and the recording of stores and spare gear usage.

67\. The chief engineer officer shall ensure that the officer in charge of the engineering watch is informed of all preventive maintenance, damage control, or repair operations to be performed during the engineering watch. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall be responsible for the isolation, bypassing and adjustment of all machinery under the responsibility of the engineering watch that is to be worked on, and shall record all work carried out.

68\. When the engine-room is put in a stand-by condition, the officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that all machinery and equipment which may be used during manoeuvring is in a state of immediate readiness and that an adequate reserve of power is available for steering gear and other requirements.

69\. Officers in charge of an engineering watch shall not be assigned or undertake any duties which would interfere with their supervisory duties in respect of the main propulsion system and ancillary equipment. They shall keep the main propulsion plant and auxiliary systems under constant supervision until properly relieved, and shall periodically inspect the machinery in their charge. They shall also ensure that adequate rounds of the machinery and steering-gear spaces are made for the purpose of observing and reporting equipment malfunctions or breakdowns, performing or directing routine adjustments, required upkeep and any other necessary tasks.

70\. Officers in charge of an engineering watch shall direct any other member of the engineering watch to inform them of potentially hazardous conditions which may adversely affect the machinery or jeopardize the safety of life or of the ship.

71\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that the machinery space watch is supervised, and shall arrange for substitute personnel in the event of the incapacity of any engineering watch personnel. The engineering watch shall not leave the machinery spaces unsupervised in a manner that would prevent the manual operation of the engine-room plant or throttles.

72\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall take the action necessary to contain the effects of damage resulting from equipment breakdown, fire, flooding, rupture, collision, stranding, or other cause.

73\. Before going off duty, the officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that all events related to the main and auxiliary machinery which have occurred during the engineering watch are suitably recorded.

74\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall cooperate with any engineer in charge of maintenance work during all preventive maintenance, damage control or repairs. This shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:

> .1 isolating and bypassing machinery to be worked on;   
> .2 adjusting the remaining plant to function adequately and safely during the maintenance period;   
> .3 recording, in the engine-room log or other suitable document, the equipment worked on and the personnel involved, and which safety steps have been taken and by whom, for the benefit of relieving officers and for record purposes; and   
> .4 testing and putting into service, when necessary, the repaired machinery or equipment.

75\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that any engine-room ratings who perform maintenance duties are available to assist in the manual operation of machinery in the event of automatic equipment failure.

76\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall bear in mind that changes in speed, resulting from machinery malfunction, or any loss of steering may imperil the safety of the ship and life at sea. The bridge shall be immediately notified in the event of fire and of any impending action in machinery spaces that may cause reduction in the ship’s speed, imminent steering failure, stoppage of the ship’s propulsion system or any alteration in the generation of electric power or similar threat to safety. This notification, where possible, shall be accomplished before changes are made, in order to afford the bridge the maximum available time to take whatever action is possible to avoid a potential marine casualty.

77\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall notify the chief engineer officer without delay:

> .1 when engine damage or a malfunction occurs which may be such as to endanger the safe operation of the ship;   
> .2 when any malfunction occurs which, it is believed, may cause damage or breakdown of propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery or monitoring and governing systems; and   
> .3 in any emergency or if in any doubt as to what decision or measures to take.

78\. Despite the requirement to notify the chief engineer officer in the foregoing circumstances, the officer in charge of the engineering watch shall not hesitate to take immediate action for the safety of the ship, its machinery and crew where circumstances require.

79\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall give the watchkeeping personnel all appropriate instructions and information which will ensure the keeping of a safe engineering watch. Routine machinery upkeep, performed as incidental tasks as a part of keeping a safe watch, shall be set up as an integral part of the watch routine. Detailed repair maintenance involving repairs to electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or applicable electronic equipment throughout the ship shall be performed with the cognizance of the officer in charge of the engineering watch and chief engineer officer. These repairs shall be recorded.

**Engineering watchkeeping under different conditions and in different areas**

*Restricted visibility*

80\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that permanent air or steam pressure is available for sound signals and that at all times bridge orders relating to changes in speed or direction of operation are immediately implemented and, in addition, that auxiliary machinery used for manoeuvring is readily available.

*Coastal and congested waters*

81\. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that all machinery involved with the manoeuvring of the ship can immediately be placed in the manual mode of operation when notified that the ship is in congested waters. The officer in charge of the engineering watch shall also ensure that an adequate reserve of power is available for steering and other manoeuvring requirements. Emergency steering and other auxiliary equipment shall be ready for immediate operation.

*Ship at anchor*

82\. At an unsheltered anchorage the chief engineer officer shall consult with the master whether or not to maintain the same engineering watch as when under way.

<!-- -->

83\. When a ship is at anchor in an open roadstead or any other virtually “at-sea” condition, the engineer officer in charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that:

> .1 an efficient engineering watch is kept;   
> .2 periodic inspection is made of all operating and stand-by machinery;   
> .3 main and auxiliary machinery is maintained in a state of readiness in accordance with orders from the bridge;   
> .4 measures are taken to protect the environment from pollution by the ship, and that applicable pollution-prevention regulations are complied with; and   
> .5 all damage-control and fire-fighting systems are in readiness.

**PART 5 – WATCHKEEPING IN PORT**

***Principles applying to all watchkeeping***

**General**

90\. On any ship safely moored or safely at anchor under normal circumstances in port, the master shall arrange for an appropriate and effective watch to be maintained for the purpose of safety. Special requirements may be necessary for special types of ships’ propulsion systems or ancillary equipment and for ships carrying hazardous, dangerous, toxic or highly flammable materials or other special types of cargo.

**Watch arrangements**

95\. The chief engineer officer, in consultation with the master, shall ensure that engineering watchkeeping arrangements are adequate to maintain a safe engineering watch while in port. When deciding the composition of the engineering watch, which may include appropriate engine-room ratings, the following points are among those to be taken into account:

> .1 on all ships of 3,000 kW propulsion power and over there shall always be an officer in charge of the engineering watch;   
> .2 on ships of less than 3,000 kW propulsion power there may be, at the master’s discretion and in consultation with the chief engineer officer, no officer in charge of the engineering watch; and   
> .3 officers, while in charge of an engineering watch, shall not be assigned or undertake any task or duty which would interfere with their supervisory duty in respect of the ship’s machinery system.

**Taking over the watch**

96\. Officers in charge of the deck or engineering watch shall not hand over the watch to their relieving officer if they have any reason to believe that the latter is obviously not capable of carrying out watchkeeping duties effectively, in which case the master or chief engineer shall be notified accordingly. Relieving officers of the deck or engineering watch shall ensure that all members of their watch are apparently fully capable of performing their duties effectively.

97\. If, at the moment of handing over the deck or engineering watch, an important operation is being performed, it shall be concluded by the officer being relieved, except when ordered otherwise by the master or chief engineer officer.

***Part 5-2 – Taking over the engineering watch***

100\. Prior to taking over the engineering watch, the relieving officer shall be informed by the officer in charge of the engineering watch as to:

> .10 the procedures for notifying the appropriate authority of environmental pollution resulting from engineering activities.

101\. Relieving officers, before assuming charge of the engineering watch, shall satisfy themselves that they are fully informed by the officer being relieved, as outlined above; and:

> .1 be familiar with existing and potential sources of power, heat and lighting and their distribution;   
> .2 know the availability and condition of ship’s fuel, lubricants and all water supplies; and   
> .3 be ready to prepare the ship and its machinery, as far as is possible, for stand-by or emergency conditions as required.

***Part 5-4 – Performing the engineering watch***

103\. Officers in charge of the engineering watch shall pay particular attention to:

> .1 the observance of all orders, special operating procedures and regulations concerning hazardous conditions and their prevention in all areas in their charge;   
> .2 the instrumentation and control systems, monitoring of all power supplies, components and systems in operation;   
> .3 the techniques, methods and procedures necessary to prevent violation of the pollution regulations of the local authorities; and   
> .4 the state of the bilges.

103\. Officers in charge of the engineering watch shall:

> .1 in emergencies, raise the alarm when, in their opinion, the situation so demands, and take all possible measures to prevent damage to the ship, persons on board and cargo;   
> .2 be aware of the deck officer’s needs relating to the equipment required in the loading or unloading of the cargo and the additional requirements of the ballast and other ship stability control systems;   
> .3 make frequent rounds of inspection to determine possible equipment malfunction or failure, and take immediate remedial action to ensure the safety of the ship, of cargo operations, of the port and the environment;   
> .4 ensure that the necessary precautions are taken, within their area of responsibility, to prevent accidents or damage to the various electrical, electronic, hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical systems of the ship; and   
> .5 ensure that all important events affecting the operation, adjustment or repair of the ship’s machinery are satisfactorily recorded.
