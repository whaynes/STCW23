## Engineering Systems and Safety 

### Course Description

This course will teach students the fundamental engineering concepts related to the steam and water cycle and steam generation. The students will also learn about various primary and auxiliary engineering systems. The lab familiarizes the students with the safe operation of the engine room and engineering systems on board the training ship and provides students with basic first aid and occupational safety certification. [Lab time required]

This course consists of two 1-hour classes a week for a semester, eight 3-hour labs with practical assessments, and a comprehensive final exam.

### Entrance requirements

None
