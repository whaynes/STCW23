### Course Description

Provides an opportunity for cadets to obtain sea service and engineering watchstanding experience in a structured shipboard training program which is compliant with Chapter III of STCW and the requirements of 46 CFR. The training uses a building-block approach, bringing the cadet up to an acceptable level of proficiency in each area of required competence. Shipboard training is closely integrated with the shore-based academic curriculum at the Academy which includes a range of simulation and practical lab experiences. All phases of training are conducted by STCW Qualified Instructors and Designated Examiners.

This course consists of an approximately 52-day long shipboard experence on the training vessel including watchstanding, maintenance and training.
