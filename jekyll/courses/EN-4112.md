### Course Description

Practical lab experience demonstrating the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Topics include conservation of energy, efficiency, Bernoulliâ€™s principle, frictional losses, pump analysis. Formal engineering reports are required with emphasis on writing and spreadsheet skills.

This course consists of twelve 2-hour labs, and weekly quizzes.
