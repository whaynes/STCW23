### Course Description

This course covers the requirements of the STCW Convention. The course covers the theory and practice of navigation necessary for the effective and safe navigation of a vessel, including the use of charts, position fixing by celestial observations and the extraction of information from relevant navigational publications. It introduces and focuses on the theory and practice of the use of observations of celestial bodies for determining lines of position and checking compass errors. [Lab time required]


This course consists of three 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with practrical assessments and a comprehensive final examination.

### Entrance Requirements

Successful completion of  [MT-2121](mt-2121.html) *Deep Sea Navigation*.

This course serves as a pre-requisite for [MT-3371](mt-3371.html) *Sea Term III*  /  [MT-3372](mt-3372.html) *Commercial Sea Term*.
