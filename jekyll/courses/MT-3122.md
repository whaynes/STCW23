### Course Description

This course is designed to meet all RADAR Observer knowledge-based assessments and the twelve performance-based assessments, which form part of the requirements for Officer in Charge of a Navigation Watch (STCW Table A-II/1). Students who successfully complete the course will be able to recognize when radar should be in use, select a suitable mode and range setting for the circumstances, set the controls for optimal performance, and will understand the accuracy limitations of the equipment in detecting targets. Students will also be able to compare the radar display with the chart, select suitable land targets, and use these targets to fix position. In addition, students will understand the need to maintain a continuing plot of ship targets that may pose a potential threat of collision, be able to derive from the plot the necessary information about the courses, speeds and closest points of approach of other ships, enabling timely action in accordance with 72-COLREGS and Inland Rules and preventing a close-quarters situation. This course satisfies the requirements for a USCG RADAR endorsement.  Classwork is supplemented by practical weekly labs in the Integrated Navigation Lab (INL) simulator with students working individually at each student station.  Classwork is supplemented by practical weekly labs in the Integrated Navigation Lab (INL) simulator with students working individually at each station. [Lab time required]


This course consists of two 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with practrical assessments and a comprehensive final examination.
