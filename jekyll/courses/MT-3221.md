## Electronic Navigation 

### Course Description

This course contains knowledge of basic signaling and radiotelephone communications, including Morse code, flashing light, International Code of Signals, and of distress, urgent, safety, and navigational messages. Students will gain knowledge of basic theory of electronic navigational aids and instruments, such as GPS, DGPS, AIS, fathometers and speed logs. At completion, students will appreciate the danger of exclusive reliance on information gained from instruments [Lab time required]

This course consists of three 1-hour lectures and one 2-hour lab per week for a semester with a comprehensive final examination.


### Learning Objectives

**Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the following STCW elements:**

* [OICNW-A1.04](21#OICNW-A1\.04) Ability to determine the shipâ€™s position by use of electronic navigational aids
