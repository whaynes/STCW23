### Course Description

The sea term provides an opportunity for cadets to obtain sea service as an officer in charge of a navigational watch. Shipboard training is closely integrated with the shore-based academic curriculum at the Academy. Focusing on all aspects of shipboard operations, the Junior Sea Term is an opportunity for the marine transportation cadet to explore the vessel and learn its systems. The cadet will then utilize that information while assisting in the operation of the vessel and while standing watches. The commercial sea term project is used to determine the sea term III grade.

This course consists of an approximately 52-day long shipboard experence on the training vessel including watchstanding, maintenance and training.
