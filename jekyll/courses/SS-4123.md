### Course Description

This course explores the basic foundations of International Law: its nature, history, theoretical underpinnings, and the players that make it all happen, such as states, international organizations, non-governmental groups, and corporations. In addition, because the Law of the Sea is a specialized area of International Law, much of this course will be devoted to the laws and regulations as they apply to the merchant mariner, including the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL); International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); International Safety Management (ISM) Code; Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Finally, this course will explore the basic requirements in training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers on an international level.

This course consists of three 1-hour classes a week for a semester and a comprehensive final exam.
