The candidate:

1. Adjusts the tension of lines using the ship’s winches;
2. Pays out mooring wires, under load, in a controlled manner;
3. Pays out mooring lines, on bitts, under load, in a controlled manner;
4. Takes in slack on mooring wires without sufficient tension; and
5. Takes in slack on mooring lines, on bitts and cleats, so that they have sufficient tension. 

**NOTE:** The above is performed with regard to personnel working in the area, weather (both present and anticipated), cargo movement, and limitations of the ship’s operations. When heaving, appropriate safety precautions are observed, including proper number of turns on the capstan, hand placement, body position, and avoiding the piling up of line.
