The candidate:

1. Reads and understands all standing orders and special instructions;

2. Identifies work being performed, and identifies and describes personnel involved and potential hazards in the engine room;

3. Conducts a complete round of the plant, inspecting all lubricating-oil levels and adding lube-oil as necessary;

4. Records pertinent system, equipment and machinery pressures and temperatures;

5. Ensures that:

     a. The water level in the freshwater expansion tank for main and auxiliary engine is half-full;

     b. The level or capacity in the fuel oil settling and day (service) tanks are within minimum and maximum limits and notes any transfers in progress;

     c. The level or capacity in main engine lube-oil sump or sump tank, auxiliary engine lube-oil sumps, and lube-oil storage tanks are within minimum and maximum limits and notes any transfers in progress;

     d. The water levels or capacities in potable, non-potable fresh, and distilled-water tanks are within minimum and maximum limits and notes any transfers in progress;

     e. Refrigeration machinery operating parameters are monitored and recorded;

     f. Air conditioning machinery operating parameters are monitored and recorded;

     g. Potable and non-potable water  systems hydro- pneumatic tank water level are maintained at approximately half-full and the air charge pressures are maintained at recommended levels;

     h. Ship service air compressor lube-oil levels and compressed air system operating parameters are monitored, recorded, and maintained within the normal range;

     i. Ship service air compressor lube-oil level is within the normal range, recording the ship service system air compressor air discharge temperature and cooling water inlet/outlet temperatures and air flask pressure;

     j. The moisture from the ship service system air compressor intercooler, air moisture separating device, and air flasks/receiver are drained;

     k. The electricity generating plant voltage, current, power, power factor, and frequency are inspected;

     l. Engine lubricating oil conditioning equipment (including purifiers and filtration equipment) operating parameters are monitored and recorded;

     m. Waste-oil tank level is monitored and recorded;

     n. Sea temperature is recorded;

     o. Bilge-water holding tank soundings are recorded;

     p. Stern-tube bearing lubrication operating parameters are monitored and recorded;

     q. Compressed air is made available on deck in support of vessel operational requirements;

     r. He or she has de-watered the engine-room and cargo- hold bilge wells according to level, draft, and heel of the vessel;

     s. Wash water is made available on deck in support of vessel operational requirements; and

     t. All required entries have been appropriately made in the engine room log book;

6. Answers maneuvering orders in engine-room control; and

7. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
