4. Responds to notification from the bridge of any failures encountered during testing of the ship’s sound signals; 

5. Asks the bridge to sound the ship’s whistle; 

6. Telephones the senior engineer in the steering-gear room when the bridge makes notification that it is ready to test the steering gear; 

7. Assists the senior engineer in contacting the navigation bridge when ready to test the steering gear; 

8. During testing of the steering gear, observes the “run” indicator lights and power failure alarms and makes note that they are functional; 

9. Receives the report from the bridge that the testing of the ship’s internal communications, whistle, engine order telegraph, and steering gear have been completed;
