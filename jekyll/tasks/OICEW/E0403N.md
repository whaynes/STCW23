The candidate:

1. Opens the brine pump/eductor overboard skin valve;

2. Opens the brine pump eductor saltwater supply valve;

3. Opens the vacuum pump/eductor saltwater supply valve;

4. Opens the saltwater feed pump discharge and suction valves;

5. Starts the saltwater feed pump to supply both the evaporator eductors;

6. Closes the vacuum breaker valve atop the evaporator shell;

7. Adjusts the brine overboard discharge valve to maintain water level to just cover submerged tube nest in bottom of distiller;

8. Delays continuing with operation until 75% of operational vacuum is attained;

9. Opens the main heat source valve to distiller heating section;

10. Adjusts the main-engine jacket water distiller heating section outlet valve to maintain proper jacket-water temperature differential between inlet and outlet;

11. Adjusts the saltwater feed to distiller to maintain proper inlet temperature;

12. Continues to regulate the brine overboard pump discharge to maintain seal and brine level;

13. Starts the distillate pump;

14. Energizes the salinity indicating panel and verifies the three- way valve is de-energized and distillate is re-circulated to the evaporator;

15. Energizes the salinity indicating panel and verifies the three- way valve is de-energized and distillate is re-circulated to the evaporator;

16. Continues to adjust the saltwater supply valve, controlling saltwater feed temperature, and brine overboard flow rate;

17. Monitors the distillate pump salinity level output;

18. Verifies the tank to be replenished is lined up;

19. Energizes the three-way valve when the distillate salinity level is below alarm level;

20. Verifies the salinity meter reading by comparing to chemical test of a 50 ml sample;

21. Records the meter reading once discharge to tank has been established; and

22. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
