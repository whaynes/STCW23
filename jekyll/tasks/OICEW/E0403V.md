The candidate:

1. While the compressor is running, closes the main liquid line (king) stop valve;

2. Allows the compressor to cycle off in automatic by the action of the low pressure cut-out switch;

3. While observing the refrigerant receiver level, ensures that the compressor does not restart by the action of the low pressure cut-out switch and insures that the system is completely pumped down to the receiver;

4. With compressor shutdown and not short-cycling, depresses the motor controller stop button;

5. Keeps power available to the compressor motor for the purpose of maintaining the crankcase oil warm via the heater circuit;

6. Isolates the compressor by closing the suction and discharge stop valves;

7. Isolates the water-cooled condenser by closing the condensing water isolation valves (drains the condenser watersides if required); and

8. For chillers, isolates the chiller by closing the chilled water isolation valves.
