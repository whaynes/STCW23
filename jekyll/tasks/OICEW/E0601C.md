The candidate takes the following actions, describing them as they are performed:

1. Inspects alternator for loose cable connections, brush rigging, and loose items that may damage unit during start-up;

2. Inspects coupling between turbine/reduction gear and alternator for readiness;

3. Inspects governor unit, reduction gear casing, and bearing housings for indications of lubrication leaks;

4. Inspects manual over-speed trip for excessive wear;

5. Determines level of lube-oil in sump and adds lube-oil as necessary;

6. Manually trips and resets over-speed trip to determine operation without binding;

7. Inspects auxiliary circulator pump and its piping for leaks and cracks;

8. Verifies that sea suction and discharge valves are open to auxiliary circulator;

9. Inspects auxiliary condensate pump and its piping for leaks and cracks;

10. Verifies that hot well condensate level is visible;

11. Verifies that suction, discharge, and vent line valves to auxiliary condensate pump are open;

12. Inspects auxiliary circulator and condensate pump motor controllers for readiness;

13. Starts auxiliary circulator;

14. Vents-off condenser heads and observes stabilizing of circulated water pressure;

15. Starts auxiliary condensate pump;

16. Adjusts opening of re-circulating valve to maintain visible level of condensate in hot well;

17. Returns to operating level and applies gland seal steam to turbine rotor;

18. Admits operating steam to air ejectors, adjusting supply pressure as necessary;

19. Determines visible level in hot well, adjusting re-circulating valve as necessary;

20. Starts lube-oil supply to unit when vacuum reaches 18-22 inches (obtain assistance if pump is hand-operated);

21. Sets throttle valve;

22. Slowly opens throttle valve, gradually increasing turbine rotating speed;

23. Allows unit to rotate without load for even warming;

24. Applies lube-oil and alternator cooler water supply as necessary; and

25. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
