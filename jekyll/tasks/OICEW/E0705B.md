2. On a running generator, not connected to the bus, shuts off valve to low LO shut down sensor;

3. With one steering gear motor running, interrupts power via circuit breaker on main switchboard to test if other unit starts automatically; and

4. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations. 

B)  *Z-Drive equipped vessel*
