* Successfully complete MMA Assessment  [OICEW-8E2B](OICEW-8E2B) *Centrifugal pump maintenance (packing)*
* Successfully complete MMA Assessment  [OICEW-8-2A](OICEW-8-2A) *Centrifugal pump maintenance (mechanical seal)*

The candidate:

1. Correctly plans for the job, using the proper sequence of actions to examine an operating rotary pump (without a mechanical seal) to tighten an excessively leaking packing stuffing box and determines if further examination of the pump is required;

2. Determines through visual inspection if leakage of pumped fluid is dripping at an acceptable rate;

3. Determines (for saltwater cooling service) if leakage is cool to the touch;

4. Determines by using a set of dividers if packing is evenly distant from casing;

5. Tightens packing gland by turning both packing gland nuts by a 1‚ÅÑ4-turn before additional tightening to maintain a parallel position of the gland with the casing;

6. Looks for a reduction in leakage and ascertains by touch if the leakage has become warmer;

7. Continues tightening of the packing gland until the leakage is reduced to a continuous dribble and/or the leakage has begun to warm; and

8. Notifies the senior engineer if leakage flow is not stemmed and/or the leakage has warmed excessively.
