5. Checks diesel generator output amperage;
6. Checks diesel generator kilowatt output;
7. Checks diesel generator kilovolt-amp reactive output or power factor, as appropriate;
8. Checks diesel generator bearings’ temperature and oil flow;
9. Checks governor, turbocharger, and diesel engine sump lube-oil levels;
10. Checks the physical condition of pipes, tubing, and hoses for wear or leaks;
11. Observes diesel engine lube-oil and cooling-water temperatures and pressures;
12. Observes diesel engine air intake and exhaust temperatures and pressures, including air-intake filter pressure drop, as appropriate;
13. Checks start air pressure
14. Reads fuel-oil meter, day-tank levels, and observes operation of viscosimeter, if installed;
15. Checks for any unusual conditions or noises;
16. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions; and
