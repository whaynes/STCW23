The candidate:

1. Checks all line shaft-bearing sump-oil levels;
2. Checks all line shaft-bearing-oil temperatures;
3. Checks all line shaft-bearing oiler rings, where appropriate;
4. Checks the independent thrust-bearing sump level, where appropriate;
5. Checks the independent thrust-bearing lube-oil sump temperature, where appropriate;
6. Checks the independent thrust-bearing lube-oil cooler inlet and outlet temperatures, where appropriate;
7. Checks the independent thrust-bearing lube-oil supply pressure, where appropriate;
8. Checks the independent thrust-bearing gravity- head tank level, where appropriate;
9. Checks the water-lubricated stern-tube stuffing box for proper leak-off, where appropriate;
10. Checks the oil-lubricated stern-tube lube sump tank level where appropriate;
11. Checks the oil-lubricated stern-tube lube-oil pressure where appropriate;
12. Checks the oil-lubricated stern-tube oil temperatures where appropriate;
13. Checks the oil-lubricated stern-tube inboard shaft seal for leakage if appropriate;
14. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions; and
15. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
