(A) GREASE-FITTING-EQUIPPED BEARING

2. Removes the fitting protective covering if fitted, drain plug, if fitted, and wipes the fitting free of grease and dirt with a rag;
3. Removes air from the grease-gun hose by slowly squeezing the handle until grease starts to leave the fitting, and attaches the hose fitting to the bearing of the fitting;
4. Slowly pumps in grease until a small amount of clean grease appears but, if the grease meets undue resistance, the candidate notifies the watch engineer; and
5. Replaces drain plug and protective cover on grease fitting. 

(B) GREASE-CUP-EQUIPPED BEARING

1. Determines from the appropriate lubrication chart the type and grade of grease to use;
2. Obtains a sufficient clean quantity of correct grease;
3. Removes the drain plug opposite the grease cup and ensure that the hole is free from hardening grease;
4. Removes the cap from the grease cup;
5. Wipes out the grease cup with a rag;
6. Fills the grease cup with grease;
7. Installs the cap onto the grease cup and force grease into the bearing housing;
