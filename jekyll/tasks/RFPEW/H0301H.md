<div class="tooltip">Note 1
<span class="tooltiptext">
Not performing this task will limit the candidate’s endorsement to motor and/or gas-turbine propelled vessels only.

This task is not required for steam propulsion and no limitation will be placed on the steam vessel endorsement if this task is not completed.

The candidate:

1. Has the required burners prepared and ready one hour before maneuvering;
2. Verifies the fuel oil service system master (solenoid) valve is properly engaged for each boiler;
3. Verifies the fuel oil service system recirculation valve is closed;
4. Verifies the operation of the fuel oil service pump and normal discharge pressure is maintained;
5. Verifies water is visible in the boiler gauge glass at half or normal drum level;
6. Readies all burners with varying orifice sprayer plates according to vessel maneuvering operations;
7. Verifies F.O. temperature is steady at specified temperature.;
8. When directed that engine sea speed will be reduced to maneuvering speed, ensures that fuel to at least one burner in each boiler will be secured;
9. Reduces combustion air to the proper fuel/air ratio by reducing the forced draft fan speed, and/or air register opening, or combustion control board air ratio controller, or through a combination of events as is necessary; 
10. Periodically observes periscope/light intensity to modify supply of combustion air to prevent “smoking”;
11. Continually monitors boiler water level, modulating feed as necessary, avoiding feed water flow changes as an over-reaction during periods of shrink and swell due to engine speed changes;
12. Ensures that as engine speed is increased, combustion air will be increased prior to fuel flow increase by increasing forced draft fan speed, and/or air register opening, or combustion control board air ratio controller, or through a combination of events as is necessary;
13. Notifies the watch engineer of any unusual or unsafe conditions; and
14. Takes proper action to prevent safety and pollution violations.
