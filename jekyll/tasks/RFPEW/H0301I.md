The candidate:

1. Ensures that permission has been requested from the bridge before blowing tubes;
2. Manually increases the de-aerating feedwater tank (DFT) level in preparation for using the steam soot blowers;
3. Verifies that the drain valve of the soot blower steam line is open;
4. Slowly opens the soot blower steam isolation valves;
5. Observes the output from the soot blower system drain, and secures the drain valve when it is determined that only steam is present;
6. Informs the OICEW when the system is ready;
7. Increases the speed of the forced-draft fan;
8. Physically pulls on any chain drive or manually rotates any crank to operate any non-air motor-driven soot blower in its proper sequence;
9. Assists in maintaining a watch on the main propulsion boiler water level, steam, pressure, and DFT water level;
10. At the end of cycling all soot blowers, secure the steam isolation valve to the soot blowers;
11. Opens the soot blower steam line drain; and
12. Wears proper safety equipment throughout the operation; and
